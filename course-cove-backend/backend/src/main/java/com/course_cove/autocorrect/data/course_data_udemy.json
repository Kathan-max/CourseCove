Jason did an excellent job of demonstrating the difference in adult learning styles and how it's possible for both non-educators and educators plus those with presentation experience to fulfill an educational role with adult students. His material has great application possibilities for a wide variety of situations--classes, presentations to adult audiences, interviews--his work is terrific!\"- Sondra Retzlaff- Senior Marketing Coordinator and Copy Crafter at Mead & Hunt\"It's pretty simple.

Knowing how I like to learn influences how I will teach, facilitate meetings, and grow my staff. It also made me cognizant of learners who prefer different styles than my personal preference. Overall, that made me a more effective presenter since I knew exactly what I needed to work on to capture the attention of those learners\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwho are diametrically different from my personal learning/teaching style.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\u00e2\u20ac\u0153What I like most is that you emulate all the exercises we should do. In the back of my mind, I know that you have a personal learning/teaching style that you prefer\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbut you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re able to cultivate those skills so that you can adapt to your audience.

A Lot of hard work has been put to bring alive this work which is evident once you see it and this has to be appreciated. The content and the editing has been done professionally and I had an amazing viewing experience. My children loved the Multiplication methods especially squares by the duplex method. Now they can do this in till the time it takes for a dropped pin to reach the ground. Stupendous I say.\"Liam CaffreyIreland' Ancient Indian Secrets a Math Teacher should know'Nehru LallUnited Kingdom\" Great work Gaurav. Your Forum is doing a service to the society by imparting these skills to the new generation. They need this to get rid of the Math Phobia prevalent in the classrooms and I think your COURSE set fits here beautifully. The explanations offered and the repetition of the methods is good for the kids to help them grasp the method. \"Martyn RosserSouthern Pines, NCUnited States\" I am a Math teacher in Houston and its been two months since I learnt these methods from India with the help of the Complete High Speed Vedic Math COURSE set. I have started teaching these methods to my students who I coach and their eyes shine with excitement when I teach them these methods. They want to learn more and these teens who would rather be playing computer games request me to extend their class timings to learn these new methods. I over my 9 years of service have never experienced this ever and it is amazing that the High Speed Vedic Math system is able to do so!\"Pilip Mmillan, JrMilwaukee, WIUnited States\"I think I can achieve a Grade A in my Next Math Exam. Its possible. Prof.Tekriwal's Vedic Math Methods are out of this world. Its like Harry Potter's Magic working with Math.\"Ronald KayePontypool, TorfaenUnited Kingdom\" The Division Method you taught and explained is fastest. You are correct. I now can challenge my friends to get answers correct to 5 decimal places faster than me. I beat them on all counts.\"Francis RyanPerth Western AustraliaAustralia\" My child Vivian was Math-Phobic. When I found your website and learnt about the advantages of the COURSE set I thought it might help Vivian. It was initially very difficult to have him sit through the COURSE set. But all of a sudden when the Base Method topic was going on\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6something caught his attention and he sat for the full 3 hours. He sat up till late in the evening and was scribbling in his notebook which when I saw was filled up with calculations which he had solved using your Vedic Math Method. Vivian is now eager to complete the course and he thinks that these methods are friendly and would help him. Thank you Mr.Tekriwal for showing my child the way.\"William PerryColumbus, OHUnited States\" I am home-schooling my child. This Indian method attracted me when I did some of the tutorials given on the website. I thought it would help my son to overcome his math problems. I got the Vedic Math COURSE set and showed some of the methods. I was skeptical that this would overwhelm my child hence I thought of going over it myself first and to my amazement these COURSEs clarify the Math Concepts beautifully without any hysteria over the speed. The idea is to do the sum using the basic simple system and then if its happen in speed that's a bonus you get. Thomas has now joined me and we solve the sums together. Sometimes he teaches me a new concept. Thankyou.\"Terrence BrannonTaylorsville, CAUnited States\" Its simply magical and it has introduced me to a Wonderland of Numbers\"Margaret RittenhouseLeonia, NJUnited States\" Thankyou for your permission to allow us to have a 2 hour screening of the Vedic Math System from your COURSE for our school. It was successful and the children were seen taking down notes. This is the first time we've ever done this and I think we would have more of such sessions in the near future. We have given assignments and project work to our students on High Speed Vedic Math which will go a long way in helping them understand the concepts.\"Alejandro GomezAustin, TXUnited States",

        "description": "Hola y bienvenidos:-)(Hello and welcome)There is nothing more thrilling than being able to speak to the locals in their own language when you visit a foreign country. Well, now you can experience that amazing feeling too!My name is Kieran Ball and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been teaching foreign languages in my hometown for over fifteen years. I love languages, I love learning and I love teaching. I also love chocolate, but this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really the place to discuss my chocoholism!I created 3 Minute Spanish as a way to make learning Spanish easier than ever before and accessible to anybody, especially people who have tried and failed in the past. My course is perfect for the complete beginner as I break down the Spanish language into tiny chunks that I show you how to build back together again in a logical, simple to understand way. You can go from knowing no Spanish at all to putting together your own sentences in just a few minutes. Watch the free preview lessons below and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see what I mean.TRY THE FREE PREVIEW LESSONSI really want everybody to see that they can learn to speak Spanish, so I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve turned the first fifteen videos of this course into free previews, meaning you can watch them without even signing up. If nothing else, I just want you to see how easy it is to learn Spanish.HOW DOES 3 MINUTE SPANISH WORK?As the name suggests, each lesson in this course lasts just three minutes (more or less!). In each lesson, you learn a tiny chunk of Spanish that you can use to build sentences. As you work through the course, you learn more and more little chunks and your sentences will gradually get longer and longer.The chunks that you learn in the first lessons are carried through to the last lessons. This means you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to worry about trying to remember everything you will get so much opportunity for practice that you will find the words and phrases just sink into your brain.The lessons in this course are focused, practical and effective, and you will build language skills that you can use straight away in real-world situations. You will be able to speak Spanish comfortably and with confidence whenever you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in a Spanish speaking country.WHY 3 MINUTES?When you begin learning something new, you tend to start off with lots of excitement and motivation. You might spend a few hours on the first day learning, but then the next day, you can only manage one hour, and then that goes down to half an hour, and then you get bored and you give up. Well, the reason behind the very short lessons is that it helps you to stay motivated and it also enhances the learning process.By keeping your learning to short chunks, you will find three wonderful things start to happen:1. You will maintain enthusiasmIf you want to learn anything, you have to maintain enthusiasm or else you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t continue. If you limit your study time to just three minutes, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll keep Spanish fresh and exciting and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be eager to learn. If you spend hours studying, very quickly you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get bored with Spanish and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll turn into a chore.2. You will study more consistentlyIt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much better to study for just three minutes once a day than to study for three hours once a week. A spare three minutes is relatively easy to find even in the most hectic of schedules. If you make sure you complete at least one three-minute study session every day, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll quickly become a habit that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll do without thinking. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much easier to fit in a daily three-minute habit than a weekly one-hour habit. By doing this, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll become a much more consistent learner, and consistency is the key to success.3. You will remember things betterThis is my favourite reason as to why you should limit your study to just three-minute chunks. If you study something for just three minutes every day, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll trick your brain into memorising the information more quickly than if it were to see the information for hours each day. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll think, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I see this information every day so it must be important, but I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see it for very long, so I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d better hold onto it and make it into a memory fast!\u00e2\u20ac\u009d You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be amazed at how much more easily things tend to stay in your brain if you limit yourself to just three minutes a day.So, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why I keep the lessons to just three minutes.A METHOD THAT REALLY WORKSI can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite believe it, but over 150,000 people in more than 200 countries have now used 3 Minute Languages to learn to speak a foreign language. It still amazes me when I get an email from somebody on the other side of the world telling me how much they have enjoyed learning Spanish with me. Apart from the thrill it gives me to find out people are listening to my voice in places like Mongolia, Peru and even Fiji, it also confirms to me that the 3 Minute Languages courses work.So, if you want a course that teaches you to speak Spanish you can use in everyday situations using a simple and fun method, then sign up to 3 Minute Spanish today.Gracias :-)Kieran",

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll think, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I see this information every day so it must be important, but I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see it for very long, so I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d better hold onto it and make it into a memory fast!\u00e2\u20ac\u009d You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be amazed at how much more easily things tend to stay in your brain if you limit yourself to just three minutes a day.So, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why I keep the lessons to just three minutes.A METHOD THAT REALLY WORKSI can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite believe it, but over 130,000 people in more than 200 countries have now used 3 Minute Languages to learn to speak a foreign language. It still amazes me when I get an email from somebody on the other side of the world telling me how much they have enjoyed learning Italian with me. Apart from the thrill it gives me to find out people are listening to my voice in places like Mongolia, Peru and even Fiji, it also confirms to me that the 3 Minute Languages courses work.So, if you want a course that teaches you to speak Italian you can use in everyday situations using a simple and fun method, then sign up to 3 Minute Italian today.Grazie :-)Kieran",

        "description": "Welcome to course 2 :-)This is is the second course in the 3 Minute French series, and it consists of lessons 10 to 18. If you're familiar with all the words and phrases you learnt in course 1, then you're ready to jump straight in!The good thing about the 3 Minute French courses is that everything you learn is recapped in later lessons, so you don't have to worry about going back to the start to refresh your memory (although you can if you want it won't harm you!). Just like with the first course, at the end of every lesson are some recap practice exercises to make sure words and phrases you learnt previously are still secure in your memory.In this course, you'll start to look at some different sentence structures in French. You'll be looking at some ways to ask questions and then you'll get an introduction to a very useful part of the language: verbs. All of this will open up the French language to you, giving you many more things to say. Don't worry if you've never come across verbs before, or if you've had a bad experience with learning grammar everything in this book is explained in a simple and easy to understand way.As well as the new structures, we'll be exploring some new topic areas including telling the time in French, booking taxis and asking where things are. We'll also look at an interesting linguistic feature in English called the Saxon Genitive, and we'll discover that it doesn't exist in French so we'll need ways to get around it.The best way to tackle the trickier features of any language is to spread them out rather than looking at them all at once. Sometimes, when you open a foreign language instruction book, all the linguistic features of the language are introduced on the first page, and it can often be very off putting! In the 3 Minute French courses, I have broken them down and spread them about. We look at each particular feature when it crops up naturally in the order of the course. In this course, there are a few such features that need explaining in order to understand how some of the French structures work.In this course, there are also some more Vocabulary Expansion Sheets for you to boost your French vocabulary.I hope you enjoy :-)",

        "description": "Hallo und wilkommen:-)(Hello and welcome)There is nothing more thrilling than being able to speak to the locals in their own language when you visit a foreign country. Well, now you can experience that amazing feeling too!My name is Kieran Ball and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been teaching foreign languages in my hometown for over fifteen years. I love languages, I love learning and I love teaching. I also love chocolate, but this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really the place to discuss my chocoholism!I created 3 Minute German as a way to make learning German easier than ever before and accessible to anybody, especially people who have tried and failed in the past. My course is perfect for the complete beginner as I break down the German language into tiny chunks that I show you how to build back together again in a logical, simple to understand way. You can go from knowing no German at all to putting together your own sentences in just a few minutes. Watch the free preview lessons below and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see what I mean.TRY THE FREE PREVIEW LESSONSI really want everybody to see that they can learn to speak German, so I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve turned the first fifteen videos of this course into free previews, meaning you can watch them without even signing up. If nothing else, I just want you to see how easy it is to learn German.HOW DOES 3 MINUTE GERMAN WORK?As the name suggests, each lesson in this course lasts just three minutes (more or less!). In each lesson, you learn a tiny chunk of German that you can use to build sentences. As you work through the course, you learn more and more little chunks and your sentences will gradually get longer and longer.The chunks that you learn in the first lessons are carried through to the last lessons. This means you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to worry about trying to remember everything you will get so much opportunity for practice that you will find the words and phrases just sink into your brain.The lessons in this course are focused, practical and effective, and you will build language skills that you can use straight away in real-world situations. You will be able to speak German comfortably and with confidence whenever you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in a German speaking country.WHY 3 MINUTES?When you begin learning something new, you tend to start off with lots of excitement and motivation. You might spend a few hours on the first day learning, but then the next day, you can only manage one hour, and then that goes down to half an hour, and then you get bored and you give up. Well, the reason behind the very short lessons is that it helps you to stay motivated and it also enhances the learning process.By keeping your learning to short chunks, you will find three wonderful things start to happen:1. You will maintain enthusiasmIf you want to learn anything, you have to maintain enthusiasm or else you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t continue. If you limit your study time to just three minutes, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll keep German fresh and exciting and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be eager to learn. If you spend hours studying, very quickly you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get bored with German and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll turn into a chore.2. You will study more consistentlyIt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much better to study for just three minutes once a day than to study for three hours once a week. A spare three minutes is relatively easy to find even in the most hectic of schedules. If you make sure you complete at least one three-minute study session every day, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll quickly become a habit that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll do without thinking. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much easier to fit in a daily three-minute habit than a weekly one-hour habit. By doing this, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll become a much more consistent learner, and consistency is the key to success.3. You will remember things betterThis is my favourite reason as to why you should limit your study to just three-minute chunks. If you study something for just three minutes every day, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll trick your brain into memorising the information more quickly than if it were to see the information for hours each day. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll think, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I see this information every day so it must be important, but I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see it for very long, so I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d better hold onto it and make it into a memory fast!\u00e2\u20ac\u009d You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be amazed at how much more easily things tend to stay in your brain if you limit yourself to just three minutes a day.So, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why I keep the lessons to just three minutes.A METHOD THAT REALLY WORKSI can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite believe it, but over 130,000 people in more than 200 countries have now used 3 Minute Languages to learn to speak a foreign language. It still amazes me when I get an email from somebody on the other side of the world telling me how much they have enjoyed learning German with me. Apart from the thrill it gives me to find out people are listening to my voice in places like Mongolia, Peru and even Fiji, it also confirms to me that the 3 Minute Languages courses work.So, if you want a course that teaches you to speak German you can use in everyday situations using a simple and fun method, then sign up to 3 Minute German today.Danke :-)Kieran",

We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in-the-trenches trainers who despise untested theory and believe that the best way to learn training techniques is to actually get up and teach in front of a real classroom. If that sounds like something that fits you, then welcome!

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a great way to train\u00c2\u00a0 members of your own team and get them up to speed in half the time on the latest virtual training techniques, trends and best practices.If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re aconsultant, this course is a practical way to show that you are a Virtual Training Specialist, which could help you attract better, higher-paying clients, boost their ROI and efficiency, and lower turnover, safety and security concerns.If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re astudent, this class can set you apart from other graduates who may have a business or education degree, but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the specialized skills that employers today are looking for.If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re anemployee or training professional, this course can make you more valuable to your company, which can get you that raise or promotion you may deserve (but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a reason to request).Q: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153How valuable is this Rule the Room Virtual Training Mastery course?\u00e2\u20ac\u009dA:\u00c2\u00a0The course itself is highly valuable if your goal is to set yourself apart from the competition.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s even MORE valuable than any certification is the knowledge and understanding you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to gain when you take this class and pass all the tests. You will know master virtual training. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll say that again: YOU WILL KNOW VIRTUAL TRAINING.Q: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When do I have to finish the class?\u00e2\u20ac\u009dA: You can go at whatever pace suits you best! You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got a lot of other things going on in your life, so just because you enroll in the workshop doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean you need to complete it right away. In fact, you can start and finish the workshop whenever you want. Either way, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to be there with you every step of the way to ensure you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re successful and can get finished.Q: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153How soon can I finish the virtual class?\u00e2\u20ac\u009dA: The Virtual Training Mastery class is 7 hours of video training, so if you are dedicating yourself full time to it, you could probably finish in one day, but we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recommend that. Instead, we recommend you take 3 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 7 days (if you can give your full attention to the material. If you only have a little bit of time each day, then you should dedicated 14 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 21 days to finish it up and take the test.Q: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153How certain can I be that I will be finished\u00e2\u20ac\u009dA: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s never a guarantee. If it was, then our course wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean anything. Instead, it does mean something, and because of that, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to have to work at this thing to get finished. When you do get finished, you can be certain that it will actually mean something. The class and the activities are both going to challenge you, but rest assured we make everything simple, easy to understand, and quick to learn.Q: How hard is the class?A: You can liken our virtual class to the story of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153goldilocks and the three bears\u00e2\u20ac\u009d \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not too hot and not too cold. In other words, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re hard enough that you need to study and know your stuff, but we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make them intentionally hard just to be difficult. We make them as hard as they need to be to make sure you know how to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Rule the Room\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. We believe learning doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen until a behavior change occurs, so to preserve the integrity of this class, we have made the course challenging and the activities specific to our proprietary Rule the Room Train the Trainer techniques, methodologies and recipes. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect to pass the course just because you have taken other trainings or certification courses in the past. This training is different, and the class will reflect those differences.Q: Why are Virtual Trainers so important?A: A master at virtual training that can make your virtual learning activities fun, engaging, sticky, and applicable is one of the learning team\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most valuable assets.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 A set of virtual training tools at scale can pay for itself immediately with employee growth and retention and these skills can make you truly irreplaceable.",

There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a whole bunch of benefits to knowing French. Let me just mention a few. In our global society you can make use of it in business, becoming a more valuable worker, in private life, on vacation, chatting online, reading literature and press or watching satellite TV. In some parts of the world French is either the main language spoken or one of the main ones. And I could go on and on like that...This is an intensive course, which means it covers the basics from level zero (absolute beginner) and then you wander across all the lectures and learn quite a lot of stuff. The explanations are concise and clear. You should have no difficulty following and understanding them. A lot of stuff and a lot of practice.Contents and OverviewThis course is pretty comprehensive.

        "description": "Ol\u00c3\u00a1 e bem-vindo:-)(Hello and welcome)There is nothing more thrilling than being able to speak to the locals in their own language when you visit a foreign country. Well, now you can experience that amazing feeling too!My name is Kieran Ball and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been teaching foreign languages in my hometown for over fifteen years. I love languages, I love learning and I love teaching. I also love chocolate, but this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really the place to discuss my chocoholism!I created 3 Minute Portuguese as a way to make learning Portuguese easier than ever before and accessible to anybody, especially people who have tried and failed in the past. My course is perfect for the complete beginner as I break down the Portuguese language into tiny chunks that I show you how to build back together again in a logical, simple to understand way. You can go from knowing no Portuguese at all to putting together your own sentences in just a few minutes. Watch the free preview lessons below and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see what I mean.TRY THE FREE PREVIEW LESSONSI really want everybody to see that they can learn to speak Portuguese, so I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve turned the first fifteen videos of this course into free previews, meaning you can watch them without even signing up. If nothing else, I just want you to see how easy it is to learn Portuguese.HOW DOES 3 MINUTE PORTUGUESE WORK?As the name suggests, each lesson in this course lasts just three minutes (more or less!). In each lesson, you learn a tiny chunk of Portuguese that you can use to build sentences. As you work through the course, you learn more and more little chunks and your sentences will gradually get longer and longer.The chunks that you learn in the first lessons are carried through to the last lessons. This means you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to worry about trying to remember everything you will get so much opportunity for practice that you will find the words and phrases just sink into your brain.The lessons in this course are focused, practical and effective, and you will build language skills that you can use straight away in real-world situations. You will be able to speak Portuguese comfortably and with confidence whenever you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in a Portuguese speaking country.WHY 3 MINUTES?When you begin learning something new, you tend to start off with lots of excitement and motivation. You might spend a few hours on the first day learning, but then the next day, you can only manage one hour, and then that goes down to half an hour, and then you get bored and you give up. Well, the reason behind the very short lessons is that it helps you to stay motivated and it also enhances the learning process.By keeping your learning to short chunks, you will find three wonderful things start to happen:1. You will maintain enthusiasmIf you want to learn anything, you have to maintain enthusiasm or else you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t continue. If you limit your study time to just three minutes, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll keep Portuguese fresh and exciting and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be eager to learn. If you spend hours studying, very quickly you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get bored with Portuguese and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll turn into a chore.2. You will study more consistentlyIt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much better to study for just three minutes once a day than to study for three hours once a week. A spare three minutes is relatively easy to find even in the most hectic of schedules. If you make sure you complete at least one three-minute study session every day, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll quickly become a habit that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll do without thinking. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much easier to fit in a daily three-minute habit than a weekly one-hour habit. By doing this, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll become a much more consistent learner, and consistency is the key to success.3. You will remember things betterThis is my favourite reason as to why you should limit your study to just three-minute chunks. If you study something for just three minutes every day, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll trick your brain into memorising the information more quickly than if it were to see the information for hours each day. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll think, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I see this information every day so it must be important, but I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see it for very long, so I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d better hold onto it and make it into a memory fast!\u00e2\u20ac\u009d You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be amazed at how much more easily things tend to stay in your brain if you limit yourself to just three minutes a day.So, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why I keep the lessons to just three minutes.A METHOD THAT REALLY WORKSI can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite believe it, but over 130,000 people in more than 200 countries have now used 3 Minute Languages to learn to speak a foreign language. It still amazes me when I get an email from somebody on the other side of the world telling me how much they have enjoyed learning Portuguese with me. Apart from the thrill it gives me to find out people are listening to my voice in places like Mongolia, Peru and even Fiji, it also confirms to me that the 3 Minute Languages courses work.So, if you want a course that teaches you to speak Portuguese you can use in everyday situations using a simple and fun method, then sign up to 3 Minute Portuguese today.Obrigado :-)Kieran",

Years ago I set out to find an affordable grammar resource for my students and made a startling discovery. There wasn't one! I found that too many English courses and textbooks taught unnecessary information and\u00c2\u00a0technical terminology, confusing students more than helping them. The material seemed like it was made for Englishteachersand not Englishstudents. \u00c2\u00a0Also, the materials that were okay were unnecessarily expensive. That is why I\u00c2\u00a0wroteJust the Basics of English Grammarand produced the video course Grammar Boot Camp.I wanted to give my students simple, easy tools that would actually improve their writing at a low cost.Having taught students at Advanced for 15 years, I understand the pitfalls and points of confusion that give people\u00c2\u00a0trouble. The examples and explanations in this course are tested in the classroom and have proven the most effective in helping students understand the material and master the necessary skills.Here are just a few of the skills you will learn in this course:The importance of sentence boundaries (correcting fragments and run-ons).How to avoid unnecessary shifts in tense and pronoun usage.How to write clear, to-the-point sentences, avoiding awkward and wordy phrasing.How to avoid faulty parallel structure (and what that even means).How to use the best words, especially verbs, to make your writing more powerful.When to use commas and other punctuation.How to use quotations and dialogue in your writing.TestimonialsHere is a sampling of what students are saying about Grammar Boot Camp:\"I love the course.

We start from the beginning...\u00c2\u00a0I explain the problem setup and why\u00c2\u00a0I set it up that way, the steps I take and why\u00c2\u00a0I take them, how to work through the yucky, fuzzy middle parts, and how to simplify the answer when you get it.Notes: The notes section of each lesson is where you find the most important things to remember.

The workbooks include tons of extra practice problems, so they're a great way to solidify what you just learned in that section.HERE'S WHAT SOME STUDENTS OF BECOME A CALCULUS 3 MASTER\u00c2\u00a0HAVE TOLD ME:\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Krista is an excellent teacher and her course is comprehensive. She is a clear communicator, makes complex calculus topics easily understandable, and uses video tools expertly.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d -John\u00e2\u20ac\u0153One of the best instructors that I have ever learned from. She has a\u00c2\u00a0way of explaining topics so clearly that they become fairly easy. I took her calculus 2 course because I had a hard time understanding my teacher. I finished the class with a B+ mostly because I watched her videos, read the outline that she provides and practiced\u00c2\u00a0problems in the book.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d -Desarael B.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have taken all 3 of her classes and sadly she doesn't have anymore. I honestly feel like more people including teachers should take notes on how she goes about teaching these difficult concepts. I flew through this class, not because it is easy, but because she makes it so easy to grasp everything. I am honestly bummed that this is the last leg of my journey with this incredible\u00c2\u00a0teacher. If people were half as good as she is at teaching there would be a lot more people in STEM. P.S. I am writing this review 2 months since completing her Calc 3 and have since gone on to take Partial Differentials, Linear Algebra, and Analysis. There would be absolutely no way I would've been able to learn this much in so little time without her. She gave me such a strong grasp on math and how to approach problems that I feel I have the tools to really explore so much more. Without her I'm sure I would still be learning derivatives. I would recommend this class to anyone going to college, in college, or out of college. These classes are some of the best reference materials you'll ever have. The only thing I do wish is to have some quizzes at least for the ODE's to really cement an understanding of the math. Already miss learning from you\u00c2\u00a0Krista!

These are personal dreams we hold dear, but as time passes and life gets in the way, these dreams can sometimes slip farther and farther out of reach. Formal schooling is often out of the question for busy adults. Private lessons are pricey and inconvenient. So how do we re-kindle these dreams and make them come true? That is the mission of Legacy Learning Systems: To make difficult skills accessible through multimedia self-education courses and bring personal dreams within reach.What Should You Expect from the Learn & Master Sign Language course?Everything is in One Place\u00e2\u20ac\u201d With L&M Sign Language, your lessons are laid out in an easy-to-follow, step-by-step progression with everything you need in one place.

No need to buy countless training videos from a patchwork of sources.A Comprehensive Course\u00e2\u20ac\u201d Even though this course is designed for beginners, it takes you far beyond the basics of the typical instructional DVD.

You won't find a more comprehensive multimedia training course for sign language anywhere!Support Along the Way\u00e2\u20ac\u201d Perhaps the most important thing is that you won't have to learn alone.

Or are you already a coach and want an inexpensive way to peep into another coach's views and learning about coaching.I will teach you much of what I know about being a coach and attracting clients, etc. I can teach you all of that but be willing and able to put the time in to make it happen. Like every service and every product, you will have to either hire someone to help you with marketing or if you use a company like Kajabi, they have the ability to offer online classes and create your website with all the things you need for marketing - email marketing, etc.Ask me and I will suggest other resources that are available to help you get started.In my program, I have a course online on my Kajabi site called YOU University. It contains all that I teach my clients so they can heal emotionally. They work independently on that and we meet weekly for our coaching call so they can ask questions and tell me how it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going and I can see what progress they are making in their learning.We all seem to have this magical thing I call \"attraction power\". It's a mystery. Maybe it's karma. Maybe it's what you chose before you incarnated into you. Maybe if you work the Law of Attraction, it will get you what you want. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s as if we live on two levels - the human and the spiritual. So we need to pay attention to both - no matter your way of doing so.I don't know if any business is easy but I do knowthat it is about attracting and working with clients- working with them in a unique way so that their experience is everything it can be. That means that you will be honing your skills and growing as a coach and a human being for as long as you live. And the more you attract a client, the more chance there is of referrals.You can apply this course learning to any kind of coachingor you can use it to complete some of the requirements to be a YOU University Coach.

If you need to understand English, you need this class now!Fast, powerful lessons to upskill your English language learning and personal development .Your time is important.\u00c2\u00a0 Nina's classes don't take hours and hours.Most of these entertaining English lessons are ten minutes or fewer. Full captions.LEARN HOW TO UNDERSTAND ENGLISH SPEAKERS BETTER\u00c2\u00a0FROM THE AUTHOR OF \"WHADDAYA SAY\" (Pearson Education, 45 printings)! Easy to understand ENGLISH CAPTIONS\u00c2\u00a0in each lesson!BONUS:\u00c2\u00a0 Better English pronunciation! When you understand how native English speakers REALLY speak, you can sound more like a native English speaker!Nina's highly effective, English listening program is three classes-- \"Best ESL English: English for Success Fast\" (Beginning), \"More ESL English\" Popular Listening Practice\" (Intermediate), and \"(How to Get) Your Best English\" (Advanced). This course, \"More ESL English\" is the intermediate level.If you need to talk with English speakers,YOU NEED ALL THREE LISTENING CLASSES!What's the most important skill in English?\u00c2\u00a0 If you said, \"listening\", you're right.\u00c2\u00a0 Why?\u00c2\u00a0 If we hear, \"Book is on table\", we'll never say, \"THE book is on THE table\".\u00c2\u00a0 If we don't hear \"the\", we won't think it's there, and we won't say it. That means our listening ability affects our speaking ability. The best English listeners are also potentially the best English speakers.This is the same English listening course for international learners that Nina produced for employees at major international corporations such as Toyota Motor Sales. There are easy-to-follow captions, and many listening exercises written by Nina to practice in each lesson. The goal is to begin to prepare you to hear almost every English word the way it's REALLY spoken. If you can't hear what someone says to you, you can't have a conversation with that person, so this is an essential course for any international English speaker\u00c2\u00a0who communicates with English speakers.There are three steps in Nina's English listening program. Step 1 is \"Best ESL English: English for Success Fast\". You should take that course first. This is the Step 2 listening level -- \"MORE ESL English\".Step 3 is Nina's listening course, \"(How to get) Your Best English\".There are two very different kinds of English -- written and spoken. Speed of speech changes the pronunciation of spoken English.\u00c2\u00a0 Basically, the faster native speakers talk, the more their pronunciation changes, and the harder it is to understand them, unless you learn and practice these spoken English pronunciation rules.\u00c2\u00a0 Step 1, \"Best ESL\u00c2\u00a0English: English for Success Fast\", introduced learners to the most important pronunciation rules of native English speakers (reduced forms). It introduced learners to the rhythm or \"music\" of English sentences, and many important spoken English pronunciations by real native English speakers.In this course, \"MORE ESL English\", Intermediate --Nina will teach you the next group of important pronunciation changes in natural spoken English. After you practice hearing and understanding English as it's really spoken, you'll be able to understand real English conversation much better.In the practice exercises, Nina will teach you to begin to hear almost every word.\u00c2\u00a0 Why is this important?\u00c2\u00a0 We're all connected in the world now. We can study together. Many of us want to work internationally. If you can hear almost every word of English, you can correct your own English grammar because you can hear the correct grammar more clearly. You can learn new vocabulary because you can hear the words. Your conversation will be better because at least half of conversation is listening.You'll get special secrets to quickly sound more like a native English speaker. Finally, you'll take a listening test at the end of the course to show you what your next steps should be.Nina isn't just teaching you a class. She's staying with you until you learn a skill. When your listening improves, your other English skills can also improve. Nina is available to you anytime, so feel to email her with any questions or problems.IF YOU SPEAK ENGLISH TO ANYONE, YOU NEED THIS\u00c2\u00a0CLASS.Welcome:\u00e0\u00a4\u2026\u00e0\u00a4\u201a\u00e0\u00a4\u2014\u00e0\u00a5\u008d\u00e0\u00a4\u00b0\u00e0\u00a5\u2021\u00e0\u00a4\u0153\u00e0\u00a4\u00bc\u00e0\u00a5\u20acangrezeeC\u00e1\u00ba\u00a3i thi\u00e1\u00bb\u2021n n\u00c3\u00b3i ti\u00e1\u00ba\u00bfng Anh M\u00e1\u00bb\u00b9\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0/\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0\u00ec\u009d\u0152\u00ec\u201e\u00b1 \u00eb\u00af\u00b8\u00ea\u00b5\u00ad \u00ec\u02dc\u0081\u00ec\u2013\u00b4\u00eb\u00a5\u00bc \u00ed\u2013\u00a5\u00ec\u0192\u0081\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0/\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0\u00e8\u00a9\u00b1\u00e3\u0081\u2022\u00e3\u201a\u0152\u00e3\u0081\u00a6\u00e3\u0081\u201e\u00e3\u201a\u2039\u00e3\u201a\u00a2\u00e3\u0192\u00a1\u00e3\u0192\u00aa\u00e3\u201a\u00ab\u00e8\u2039\u00b1\u00e8\u00aa\u017e\u00e3\u201a\u2019\u00e5\u0090\u2018\u00e4\u00b8\u0160\u00e3\u0081\u2022\u00e3\u0081\u203a\u00e3\u201a\u2039\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 /\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0\u00d0\u00a3\u00d0\u00bb\u00d1\u0192\u00d1\u2021\u00d1\u02c6\u00d0\u00b8\u00d1\u201a\u00d0\u00b5 \u00d1\u0081\u00d0\u00b2\u00d0\u00be\u00d0\u00b9 \u00d0\u00b0\u00d0\u00bc\u00d0\u00b5\u00d1\u20ac\u00d0\u00b8\u00d0\u00ba\u00d0\u00b0\u00d0\u00bd\u00d1\u0081\u00d0\u00ba\u00d0\u00b8\u00d0\u00b9 \u00d0\u00b0\u00d0\u00ba\u00d1\u2020\u00d0\u00b5\u00d0\u00bd\u00d1\u201a\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0/\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0Meningkatkan berbicara bahasa Inggris Amerika\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0/\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0Melhorar a fala Ingl\u00c3\u00aas Americano\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0/\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0Mejorar el habla Ingl\u00c3\u00a9s Americano\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0/\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0\u00e6\u008f\u0090\u00e9\u00ab\u02dc\u00e5\u008f\u00a3\u00e8\u00af\u00ad\u00e7\u0161\u201e\u00e7\u00be\u017d\u00e5\u00bc\u008f\u00e8\u2039\u00b1\u00e8\u00af\u00ad\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0/\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0\u00e0\u00a4\u00ac\u00e0\u00a4\u00be\u00e0\u00a4\u00a4 \u00e0\u00a4\u2026\u00e0\u00a4\u00ae\u00e0\u00a5\u2021\u00e0\u00a4\u00b0\u00e0\u00a4\u00bf\u00e0\u00a4\u2022\u00e0\u00a5\u20ac \u00e0\u00a4\u2026\u00e0\u00a4\u201a\u00e0\u00a4\u2014\u00e0\u00a5\u008d\u00e0\u00a4\u00b0\u00e0\u00a5\u2021\u00e0\u00a4\u0153\u00e0\u00a5\u20ac \u00e0\u00a4\u00ae\u00e0\u00a5\u2021\u00e0\u00a4\u201a \u00e0\u00a4\u00b8\u00e0\u00a5\u0081\u00e0\u00a4\u00a7\u00e0\u00a4\u00be\u00e0\u00a4\u00b0\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0/\u00c2\u00a0 \u00d8\u00aa\u00d8\u00ad\u00d8\u00b3\u00d9\u0160\u00d9\u2020 \u00d9\u2026\u00d8\u00ad\u00d8\u00a7\u00d8\u00af\u00d8\u00ab\u00d8\u00a9 \u00d8\u00a7\u00d9\u201e\u00d9\u201e\u00d8\u00ba\u00d8\u00a9 \u00d8\u00a7\u00d9\u201e\u00d8\u00a5\u00d9\u2020\u00d8\u00ac\u00d9\u201e\u00d9\u0160\u00d8\u00b2\u00d9\u0160\u00d8\u00a9\u00d8\u00a7\u00d9\u201e\u00d8\u00a7\u00d9\u2026\u00d8\u00b1\u00d9\u0160\u00d9\u0192\u00d9\u0160\u00d8\u00a9\u00d8\u00a7\u00d9\u201e\u00d8\u00a5\u00d9\u2020\u00d8\u00ac\u00d9\u201e\u00d9\u0160\u00d8\u00b2\u00d9\u0160\u00d8\u00a9\u00e8\u2039\u00b1\u00e8\u00aa\u017e\u00ec\u02dc\u0081\u00ec\u2013\u00b4\u00e0\u00b8\u00a0\u00e0\u00b8\u00b2\u00e0\u00b8\u00a9\u00e0\u00b8\u00b2\u00e0\u00b8\u00ad\u00e0\u00b8\u00b1\u00e0\u00b8\u2021\u00e0\u00b8\u0081\u00e0\u00b8\u00a4\u00e0\u00b8\u00a9\u00d7\u0090\u00d7\u2122\u00d7\u00a0\u00d7\u2019\u00d7\u0153\u00d7\u2122\u00d7\u00a9\u00c4\u00b0ngilizce, \u00d0\u00b0\u00d0\u00bd\u00d0\u00b3\u00d0\u00bb\u00d0\u00b8\u00d0\u00b9\u00d1\u0081\u00d0\u00ba\u00d0\u00b8\u00d0\u00b9, Ingl\u00c3\u00a9s, Anglais, Englisch, Inglese, Inggris, angle\u00c5\u00a1\u00c4\u008dina, Anh",

The story will provide rich insight into the working of God through the Holy Spirit to establish churches in cities large and small and we will see how Peter, Paul and others interacted with a sometimes hostile environment as they proceeded.We follow the movement of the inaugurated Kingdom of God through this wonderful book. There are many exciting events that provide a sense of the amazement and the\u00c2\u00a0challenge of spreading the message of Christ throughout the Empire.

        "description": "Improve your Professional\u00c2\u00a0English Communication and Speaking skillsYou have studied English grammar and have a wide vocabulary. The problem is that you find it difficult to communicate effectively in English at work. Native English speakers use lots of idioms which can be confusing. You might understand the individual words in each idiom, but you don't understand what the expressions actually mean. For example, if your boss tells you thatyou are working in a 'dog eat dog' industry, what is he trying to tell you? You understand the words but the idiom surely means something else.Understanding and usingEnglish businessidioms at workwill help you express yourself more effectively in your job. Idioms are often used as a shortcut, a way to express a concept or idea in a short and memorable way. Humans use idioms to engage their listeners\u00c2\u00a0and emphasise their ideas and opinions. If you use idioms, you will be able to express yourself in a more colourful and natural way.This 5-hour course will teach you over 75 English idioms used at work.You'll be able to build rapport with your English-speaking colleagues and clients by using the language they speak.Each video is about 3-4 minutes long and gives you a definition and an example of the idiom used in a business context. There are a couple of questions about each idiom. Think about these questions to help you remember the idioms. Finally, idioms are generally fixed expressions - you cannot change the words or the order because that will make the idiom sound strange. At the end of each lesson, you will be asked to decide if the idiom is used correctly or not in an example sentence.As well as videos,you can also download an MP3 (audio file)from the resources section of each lesson. You can upload these to your phone and listen to them whenever you want. Aim to listen to each audio recording at least three times to ensure you really learn the idioms and store them in your long-term memory.Finally, there isa 100-page ebookthat summarises the information from the video course in the resources section of the first lesson (Introduction). It is full of images from the course so it won't take you long to read and provides you with a quick and easy way to review the idioms.",

The theoretical knowledge that constitutes research methodology is therefore organised around the operational steps that form this research process for both Quantitative and Qualitative research.I have taken a very bold step in breaking down, where possible, the wall between qualitative and quantitative research by describing both methodologies parallel to one another within a common framework.This course will primarily benefit 3 groups.Students:Who are newcomers to academic research and have therefore assumed students of NOT\u00c2\u00a0having any prior knowledge.Professionals:Gain significant knowledge on concepts of\u00c2\u00a0 market research or journal writing.Academic Supervisor:Use this course to teach students about key research concepts.This course will not teach how to do statistical calculations. Statistic is not a core element of a research. You can conduct a perfect research work without conducting any statistical calculations. Moreover, the type of statistical calculations used for research varies markedly - from person to person, from discipline to discipline.Stay tuned, enjoy the course and feel free to ask questions if you have any.

        "description": "Welcome to Qualitative Data Analysis using MAXQDA. There are two main types of researches: quantitative research and qualitative research. If you look at the most of the researchers around yourself, their skills are often limited to quantitative research tools. This is mainly because qualitative researchers are still not part of the curriculum of many universities and institutions around the world. In case qualitative researchers are taught at masters or doctoral level they are presented in a very complex and esoteric manner making it very difficult for the students to comprehend the method of qualitative research. Research is all about methods and innovative ideas. You will always feel handicapped unless and until you learn the techniques on your own by right guidance and constant practice.Often in the name of qualitative research, many people analyze their data in a vague and subjective manner.My method is to use qualitative software for teaching qualitative analysis. This is because software are based on logical steps and any analysis learned through them makes the learning clear and concrete. MAXQDA is the most comprehensive software for doing mixed method research.So if you have been trying to learn qualitative analysis but you felt lost in philosophical discourses and complex terminologies of your books and course material then this course is for you. The course is developed in such a way that you will be able to plan and initiate your qualitative project from scratch without any external support. However, I always recommend reading as it broadens our mind.You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find this course useful if:You are looking to enrich yourself data analysis skills by mastering both qualitative and quantitative methods. Your research skills are incomplete unless you master both qualitative and quantitative analysis.You want to use mixed method research in your thesis, project, article or assignment.MAXQDA is the only qualitative software that offers the facility of mixed method research.You want to publish a high impact journalsYou want to teach qualitative research methodology to yourself or your students with utmost objectivity and clarity.Lifelong\u00c2\u00a0Support from the Instructor:With this course, you get lifetime access and support in case you face any problem with your qualitative data analysis. I am very quick and supportive to the problems of my students. I myself have been researchers from past 10 years so I understand the pain of being a researcher.One Months Refund Guarantee:Moreover, Udemy offers you an unconditional One Month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Refund Guarantee in case you wish to take your money back. No questions asked.Free Updates at No Extra Cost:I love building few courses which are self-contained in a sense you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to look at multiple sources or take many courses for the same. However, Rome was not built in a day, and so a good course evolves and not built in a single stint. Excellence is always a marathon. So, I keep on updating my courses by adding additional material as per new developments, student queries and time. I never split my courses for revenue or anything. \u00c2\u00a0You will get free access to all updates and new materials in future added to this course without paying anything extra.It isYour Moment of Action:Your\u00c2\u00a0 timeis precious, so look no further and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t waste it on learning qualitative analysis in bits and pieces from random YouTube videos or difficult to digest voluminous books. I have distilled all the relevant concepts that you require to carry out your analysis is an easy to understand language as much possible with a lot of examples, practice and free datasets.So, Join this course now and gift yourself the power of qualitative analysis using MAXQDA.",

        "description": "This is the second course in the 3 Minute Spanish series and it consists of lessons 10-18. If you're familiar with all the words and phrases you learnt in the course 1, then you're ready to go!The good thing about the 3 Minute Spanish courses is that everything you learn is recapped in later lessons, so you don't have to worry about going back to the start to refresh your memory (although you can if you like, it won't harm you). At the end of every lesson are some recap practice exercises to make sure words and phrases you learnt previously are still secure in your memory.In this course, you'll start to look at some different sentence structures in Spanish. You'll be looking at some ways to ask questions and then you'll get an introduction to a very useful part of the language: verbs. All of this will open up the Spanish language to you, giving you many more things to say. Don't worry if you've never come across verbs before, or if you've had a bad experience with learning grammar everything in this course is explained in a simple and easy to understand way.As well as the new structures, we'll be exploring some new topic areas including telling the time in Spanish, booking taxis and asking where things are. We'll also look at an interesting linguistic feature in English called the Saxon Genitive, and we'll discover that it doesn't exist in Spanish so we'll need ways to get around it.The best way to tackle the trickier features of any language is to spread them out rather than looking at them all at once. Sometimes, when you open a foreign language instruction book, all the linguistic features of the language are introduced on the first page, and it can often be very off putting! In the 3 Minute Spanish courses, I have broken them down and spread them about. We look at each particular feature when it crops up naturally in the order of the course. In this course, there are a few such features that need explaining in order to understand how some of the Spanish structures work.In this course, there are also some more Vocabulary Expansion Sheets for you to boost your Spanish vocabulary.I hope you enjoy :-)Kieran",

If you're familiar with all the words and phrases you learnt in the course 1, then you're ready to go!The good thing about the 3 Minute Italian courses is that everything you learn is recapped in later lessons, so you don't have to worry about going back to the start to refresh your memory (although you can if you like, it won't harm you). At the end of every lesson are some recap practice exercises to make sure words and phrases you learnt previously are still secure in your memory.In this course, you'll start to look at some different sentence structures in Italian. You'll be looking at some ways to ask questions and then you'll get an introduction to a very useful part of the language: verbs. All of this will open up the Italian language to you, giving you many more things to say. Don't worry if you've never come across verbs before, or if you've had a bad experience with learning grammar everything in this course is explained in a simple and easy to understand way.As well as the new structures, we'll be exploring some new topic areas including telling the time in Italian, booking taxis and asking where things are. We'll also look at an interesting linguistic feature in English called the Saxon Genitive, and we'll discover that it doesn't exist in Italian so we'll need ways to get around it.The best way to tackle the trickier features of any language is to spread them out rather than looking at them all at once. Sometimes, when you open a foreign language instruction book, all the linguistic features of the language are introduced on the first page, and it can often be very off putting! In the 3 Minute Italian courses, I have broken them down and spread them about. We look at each particular feature when it crops up naturally in the order of the course. In this course, there are a few such features that need explaining in order to understand how some of the Italian structures work.In this course, there are also some more Vocabulary Expansion Sheets for you to boost your Italian vocabulary.I hope you enjoy :-)Kieran",

This is good news about the past (the events of Jesus's life) and good news about the future (the renewal of all creation).We invite you to enroll in this short course based on Prof. N.T. Wright's book,Simply Good News. You will instantly get into the heart of the idea of what makes something 'good news'. You will also be brought into the world of the 1st Century writers of the New Testament in order to make more sense of what 'good news' means in our world today. You may wish to acquire Prof. Wright's book,Simply Good News, in whatever format that works for you. This course will be a great introduction to Prof. Wright's book that will allow you to live in a place where 'good news' makes a difference.",

        "description": "Learn how to measure frequency responseThe first thing you will learn from this course is to measure the frequency response of a certain speaker driver, loudspeaker or sound system. The difficult part is to get an anechoic response without an anechoic chamber. Using different measuring techniques and with the help of intuitive software, you will learn how to measure the full frequency bandwidth anechoically in your own living room. This will help you set up your audio system using measured data, or it can be used to design crossovers for your particular DIY\u00c2\u00a0loudspeaker.A little bit of electrical engineeringA sound system is a combination of both acoustical and electrical parts. You will also learn how to measure impedance and create impedance plots. Measure different electrical components like capacitors, inductors and resistors. Also, if you have an unknown speaker driver you will learn how to\u00c2\u00a0measure the Thiele / Small parameters without much fuss.Dip your feet into crossover designWhile this course will not\u00c2\u00a0teach you how to design a crossover, it will show you how to create FRD and ZMA\u00c2\u00a0files. These are frequency response and impedance files which are used in crossover design apps. At the end of the course I will show you how to load these files into such program, and tryout different circuits and see how adding crossover components behave. A comprehensive course about crossovers will be released in the near future.Do I need certain equipment?Yes, you will need 2 core pieces of gear :A measurement microphone (like miniDSP UMIK-1).A device for measuring impedance (like Dayton Audio DATS v2 (recently released v3 as of 2020).These are roughly 100$ each, but you will get a more comprehensive list of the equipment needed inside the course. With alternatives that you can buy, or more cheaper options. Also, some accessories that will make your life easier are included in the list.Software optionFor the different acoustical measurements we are going to use Room EQ Wizard (or REW). This is a free to use software. Usually, acoustics software are quite expensive and difficult to follow. However, REW is free and quite intuitive to use. Pretty much a complete package. It only misses one function, which I consider important. Don't worry, we're are not going to step up to those complicated application. I devised an Excel spreadsheet which handles this shortcoming. You will find the spreadsheet inside the course.Nov 2018 Update -Added English subtitles.June 2019 Update -Corrected a measurement error for the 3-way speaker and added more info to that sectionJan 2020 Update -Update the equipment list",

The material and thought processes learned in this class will be of great benefit to you in any other application where you are analyzing relationships between objects and applying math concepts.Why is this course better than the others?Have you ever been in a class and been frustrated by the lack of fully-worked examples? This will not be that class.\u00c2\u00a0 I understand the frustration - I used to feel the same way.\u00c2\u00a0 Because of that, I teach my classes in a way that I would've preferred as a student.\u00c2\u00a0 Handwritten notes, simple explanations, and plenty of examples in a variety of difficulty levels.\u00c2\u00a0 You will not find PowerPoint slides here. To test your knowledge there are exams.\u00c2\u00a0 In case you get stuck, video solutions are provided. I also don't assume you know more than you do - we'll start with the basics and work our way up to more complex material.What will I learn in this course?Some of the topics we will cover:- Vector and scalar operations- Cartesian vectors- Projection of a force along a line- Free body diagrams- 2-D and 3-D equilibrium for particles and rigid bodies- Moments of forces- Couple moments- Methods of joints and sections- Centroids- Moments of inertia- Internal Loadings- and more!What do I need to know before starting?The typical prerequisites for this class are Physics 1 and Calculus.\u00c2\u00a0 We will be using a few derivatives and integrals so you should be familiar with those concepts. We will cover everything else you need.Is there a recommended textbook?I, along with most students I've taught, really like theEngineering Mechanics - Staticstext by Hibbeler.\u00c2\u00a0 If you don't already have a textbook this one would be a great resource, although it is not required for this course.All the examples in this course come from the 14th Edition ofEngineering Mechanics - Staticsby Hibbeler.Why wait?

Why should I enroll inthiscourse?This course covers all the topics needed to gain an understanding of the basics of thermodynamics.\u00c2\u00a0 We will cover:Pressure and temperatureWork and energy of closed systemsSteam TablesEnthalpyCompressibility chartsIdeal gas modelMass flow ratesWork and energy of control volumesThermodynamic efficienciesEntropyAnd more!What sets this course apart from others is the number of worked\u00c2\u00a0 examples.\u00c2\u00a0 Being an instructor of Thermodynamics for many years, I\u00c2\u00a0 understand the need for examples.\u00c2\u00a0 So many instructors simply show a\u00c2\u00a0 solution to a problem or only solve it halfway and just assume the\u00c2\u00a0 student knows how to finish it.This used to be one of my biggest\u00c2\u00a0 frustrations as a student so I can relate when I hear today's students\u00c2\u00a0 complain about this.\u00c2\u00a0 To prevent this frustration, this course has many,\u00c2\u00a0 many fully-worked example problems in a range of difficulty levels. I also don't assume you know more than you do.\u00c2\u00a0 We start with the basics and work our way up to more complex material.Now, what good is learning material if you can't check your understanding, right?\u00c2\u00a0 To assist with this, quiz problems are provided\u00c2\u00a0 throughout the course.\u00c2\u00a0 To check your work, video solutions of each quiz are provided.In addition, the outline of the notes I use in the videos is provided as a downloadable file to help you follow along during the\u00c2\u00a0 course.Will the material taught\u00c2\u00a0 prepare me for other courses?The relationships between pressure, temperature, density, work and energy are fundamental to so many areas.\u00c2\u00a0 As such, this course will prepare you for more advanced topics likeCombustionHeat transferFluid mechanicsPropulsionAerodynamicsAnd many othersHow's the course structured and what prior knowledge is needed?\u00c2\u00a0 Do I need a book?You will have handwritten lectures followed by fully worked examples.\u00c2\u00a0 There are NO PowerPoint slides used in this course.\u00c2\u00a0 From my experience\u00c2\u00a0 students learn best when following along and writing the notes versus\u00c2\u00a0 just listening to someone talk while staring at a bunch of slides.\u00c2\u00a0 And of course, throughout the class you will have the opportunity to test your knowledge using quizzes.The examples we cover do use basic concepts from Calculus such as\u00c2\u00a0 derivatives and integrals.\u00c2\u00a0 In order to understand the material and\u00c2\u00a0 examples you should know these concepts.As for the textbook, I will be using the 8th Edition ofFundamentals of Engineering Thermodynamicsby Moran, Shapiro, Boettner, and Bailey.\u00c2\u00a0 ISBN: 978-1118412930.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0Although not required, this book is a great resource and I strongly\u00c2\u00a0 encourage you to get a copy for yourself.\u00c2\u00a0 We will be covering the first\u00c2\u00a0 6 chapters of this text.What are you waiting for?

        "description": "The Gospel of John has been a favorite of many readers of the New Testament and is full of beauty, mystery, and, occasionally, surprises. Jesus, in this Gospel, points to a new way of living. It is the Kingdom of God way of life. This way of life was in contrast to the normal Roman way of living in the first century A.D as much as it is in contrast to what most people in the twenty-first century experience.The course approaches the Gospel of John in a way that looks at seven key themes. These themes bind the Fourth Gospel together in a manner that allows us to see this 'new way of living' as possible for followers of King Jesus. In so doing, we then apply these themes to the current era in order to ask ourselves questions about how we are putting them into practice. In a way, this is the story of how to live out being the presence of God on earth through the indwelling of God's spirit.Students will encounter these seven themes through understanding many biblical references which Prof. Wright explains. The course is not an 'exegetical' walk through the text. Rather, the explanation of cultural and historical background of our era is explored to help us apply the Gospel of John to today's world. This makes the study very application oriented.",

        "description": "What is System Dynamics and Controls about?This course provides a great introduction to controls and mathematical modeling of mechanical systems. What does that mean? Well, you will learn how to generate equations that can be used to model a body's motion.\u00c2\u00a0 Think of a pendulum swinging - after this course you will be able to model this type of motion using differential equations and matrices. On top of that, you'll be able to analyze system stability, calculate how much error is present, use Laplace transforms to solve initial value problems and much, much more!Here's some of what you will learn:Laplace transformsTransfer functionsResponse equationsEquations of motion of mechanical and electrical systemsFirst order responseSecond order responseState space representationBlock diagram reductionStability and Routh's CriterionSteady state error analysisRoot locusAnd if that's not enough, for those wishing to use MATLAB, examples and applications are provided throughout the course.\u00c2\u00a0 This helps gives more of a visual understanding of what's going on besides just looking at equations.Who should enroll?This course is perfect for you if:you are a current student in a similar class and are needing additional examples/explanationsyou are studying for the Fundamentals of Engineering exam and need a review of system response and block diagramsyou are just curious and want to learn something newIs any prior knowledge needed?Yes! The typical math requirement for this course is Differential Equations and Linear Algebra.\u00c2\u00a0 Dynamics...you need to know that too, as we will be modeling bodies in motion. MATLAB is helpful but not required - I kept all the MATLAB examples separate for students not interested in that material.What's the format of the course? Do I need a book?Let me just say that I hate engineering courses taught with PowerPoint slides.\u00c2\u00a0 Due to this, you will not find slides here.\u00c2\u00a0 I think people learn better when they have to write the material. That means the majority of my lectures are handwritten.\u00c2\u00a0 We will work through many examples and I don't assume you know more than you do.\u00c2\u00a0 We'll start with the basics and build on them.\u00c2\u00a0 You'll also get a brief outline of notes to help you follow along and to help minimize the length of the videos.Speaking of video length... am I the only one who doesn't like watching hour-long lecture videos? I didn't think so.\u00c2\u00a0 To eliminate that frustration my lectures are broken up into shorter segments, typically 12-15 minutes.\u00c2\u00a0 And if you are here for examples, I made them easy to find.\u00c2\u00a0 Almost all the examples are in their own videos, that way you can look through the notes and pick and choose which ones you want to watch.Would it be helpful to have a book? Yeah probably.\u00c2\u00a0 Is it absolutely necessary? Probably not.\u00c2\u00a0 The benefit of having a book is having more examples and problems to work on your own.\u00c2\u00a0 The book I recommend and always use for this course isControl Systems Engineeringby Nise.\u00c2\u00a0 It gets good reviews from students and it provides a solid foundation for more advanced controls classes.Will this prepare me for other classes?Most definitely! The fundamental knowledge gained in this course will be useful in classes such as Mechanical Vibrations, Feedback Control Systems, and others.\u00c2\u00a0 In addition, you'll gain a greater understanding of differential equations and how they are used to model system behavior.\u00c2\u00a0 The state space info will be helpful in graduate-level topics such as Kalman filtering.What are you waiting for?

Yes..? Think again..!Is your Demand only a function of price?What is supply?What affects supply of a good in the market?We, as buyers, want to pay as low a price as possible sellers, on the other hand, want to charge as high a price as possible, seems like there\u00c2\u00a0 are opposite interests here, then who gets to decide the price?How does this price mechanism function?2) Product Pricing Decisions - Price Elasticity of Demand and SupplyThis part is covered in Section 4 (Elasticity of Demand) and Section 5 (Elasticity of Supply).In this part, you will understand how to analyse demand and supply with greater precision and the product pricing mechanism.We will go through\u00c2\u00a0the following topics:What is Price Elasticity of Demand?How much product\u00c2\u00a0pricing power do you have?How to calculate Elasticity?What is Price Elasticity of Supply?What affects Price Elasticity of Supply?This course is not only for the students of Economics but for anyone who has an interest in understanding these powerful mechanisms.It is abeginner level courseand all the topics and concepts start from scratch, so even if you are not familiar with Economics, you may take this as your first step to understand this powerful subject.All that said, if you would like to discuss something while you are learning, please feel free to start a discussion or PM me.Let's get started..!",

I've lived my life with an OK ability to converse and a good amount of vocab, but I never learned it properly. Unfortunately, there's very few resources for learning English-> Viet Southern Dialect, since the Northern/Hanoi dialect is the official preference and more relevant for business. Since there were very few resources for improving Southern dialect, I mostly gave up on developing my own Vietnamese. So I was very happy to see a course specifically aimed for Southern dialect on Udemy! After completing this course, I am really pleased with the quality of the lessons. Greg is comprehensive, thorough and attuned to the tonal nuances of the language.So if you're like me, a Viet Kieu with a desire to improve, this is an excellent course and I highly recommend it.\" - Kim T\"Although I have not completed the course yet,I have already benefited greatly from Greg's insight of the Vietnamese language.\" - Gerald Morton\"I've taken lessons from several Vietnamese teachers andthis one is my favorite by far!\"- Tiffany Bennet\"Love the building-blocks approach.\"- Tony LuvonneThis course is for anyone who wants tobecome fluent in the Vietnamese languageor simply learn some conversational phrases and vocabulary before making a trip to Vietnam. It's also for anyone seeking to simplycommunicate with your Vietnamese friends or neighbors.It is designed toteach you Vietnamese in the shortest possible timeframe by using the same strategies that I used when I first learned the language while living in Vietnam. I'll teach you tricks and tips along the way that allow you to understand popular phrases and slang, as well as how toproperly pronounce the difficult tonesand accents of Vietnamese.I have structured the course into short, instructional videos that allow you to focus on one subject at a timewithout getting overloaded with too much information. I have adapted some of the grammar and sentence structures from the very popular language textbooks used at the University of Sociology and Language Arts in Ho Chi Minh City which are the core building blocks of the language.Everything in the course isuseful in everyday situationsso you will never be spending time studying something that is not totally applicable in the real world right away. Most language courses have a lot of this kind of superfluous material which is quite inefficient and waste a lot of time covering unnecessary vocabulary and grammar rules.

The course is broken down into four main areas.Firstly we will start the course with an overview to systems thinking making a clear distinction between or traditional methods of analytical reasoning and the alternative method of synthesis that forms the foundations of system thinking.Next we will delve into systems theory to start building our model of a system, clearly defining what exactly a system is and is not. During the rest of this section we will build upon this model by adding the concepts of efficiency, functionality and talking about energy and entropy.In the third section to the course we will develop our model into a more powerful framework by adding the concept of the system\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s environment, discussing systems boundaries, synergistic interactions between systems and the emergence of hierarchical structure out of these synergies.In the last section we will look at different models for capturing how systems change over time what is called system dynamics, here we will explore the ideas of feedback loops, causal loop diagrams and the phenomena of homeostasis. Finally we wrap-up the course with a discussing of systems science, looking at how and why it is of relevance to us.",

Too many times Jesus of Nazareth becomes interpreted as simply another 'religious figure' among many religious figures. But this so often eliminates the understanding of a man who lived in time and space at a critical time of history.This course is meant for all audiences. No previous theological study is required or expected. In this way it is meant to give a basic understanding of Jesus as a figure in history primarily.Prof. Wright will lecture on key biblical texts to walk the student through the different elements that constitute the story of Jesus. In addition there you will have discussion questions to help you think more intently about the material presented.This course tries to focus on essential biblical texts and non-biblical historical material to embrace the larger story of a Jesus of history. This course is to be taken in tandem with the reading of Prof. Wright's book,Simply Jesus.\u00c2\u00a0 InSimply Jesus, bestselling author and leading Bible scholar N.T. Wright summarizes 200 years of modern Biblical scholarship and models how Christians can best retell the story of Jesus today. In a style similar to C.S. Lewis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s popular works, Wright breaks down the barriers that prevent Christians from fully engaging with the story of Jesus.We trust that the material and the dialogue with other students will be encouraging and enlightening for all.",

        "description": "Our Students Share Their Experience:It\u00c2\u00b4s unbelievable the EXTRAORDINARY work that Jackson has made in the preparation of this course. I bought many other courses in udemy and other platforms that sell \"get 700+, from zero to 700+, etc\" but were very poor courses. But this one is Amazing, the teacher is really worried for you to understand. The best Gmat course!-Hernando Fierro\"This is a great review for anyone who is hoping to brush up on their quant skills going into the GMAT. I did my first practice exam 6 weeks before my exam date and scored a 640, with the quant section being the main area that I needed to improve on. After 12 years, I got in touch with my high school math teacher who forwarded me grade 11 and 12 textbooks, which were helpful, but honestly, just too much content to get through in a short time. I found this course on Udemy, and found it to be very helpful because it is broken out so clearly and the instructor has a very good way of explaining the concepts. There were probably only 2-3 times in the whole 40 hours where I knew that there was a faster way to solve the problems. Also, because Udemy has the function available to speed up, if you are reasonably familiar with certain sections, you can watch it at 2.0x, etc. Anyway, long story short, I got 710 on my GMAT yesterday, with a 48/51 on the quant section and purchased this course only 30 days before that. (Don't get me wrong, I put in a lot of hours in those days, but I still think that's a great result.) This plus the official practice questions and exams, and online forums for particular questions was the key to my success, but the practice questions don't give you any indication about the breadth of concepts or whether you're anywhere near being familiar with all of them. This course was critical for that - thank you very much! \"-Chloe CameronI really liked this course, and found it very comprehensive. Jackson has meticulously designed the course structure and prudently selected the sequencing of concepts. I felt both adequately coached and intellectually challenged at various points in the course to get a very holistic learning experience overall. Would highly recommend this to anyone preparing for GMAT.-Karan KapoorWell Done, very helpful and the content actually motivated me- Farhan HasanOne word which describes the instructor: Diligence. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get good value for your money and even more.-Adaora AnyantiGreat course! I just went through all the concepts and am about to start working on some problem questions that I saved for later. I solved several easier problem questions and Jackson provides great explanations to guide me through how to solve better or more efficient. I am not good at math but Jackson provides great solutions step by step to make it easier to understand math. There are some sections that I don't understand how to solve questions but Jackson promptly replies to your questions. This is very important for me to understand the material thoroughly and to move forward to the next question with confidence. Overall, 5 stars both on course material and instructor's attentiveness! Highly recommend this course to everyone who is preparing for GMAT. -Yosuke TomitaFast paced, direct to the point and very well handled when it comes to explanations.

This course not only gave me the knowledge, insight, and skills to excel in this new role, but the confidence to implement these new skills and to share this knowledge with others.\u00e2\u20ac\u009dLorielle Ouimette-\u00c2\u00a0Physician Software Trainer\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Jason\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s passion for helping trainers is so contagious. When I work with him, not only do I want to be a better trainer, I want to be able to help others the way that he helped me.\u00e2\u20ac\u009dSarah Gernetzke- Corporate Trainer at Epic\u00e2\u20ac\u0153You taught me and many, many other trainers here how to not only survive in the classroom, but how to thrive. We owe you a big thanks.\u00e2\u20ac\u009dPaul Mellon- Software Trainer\u00e2\u20ac\u0153So many of us have become better instructional designers/presenters/trainers/etc. as a result of your tips and in turn helped our customer trainers grow in their presentation skills as well.\u00e2\u20ac\u009dLauren Wons- Training Team Lead\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Jason\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s experience with teaching and working with our trainers and trainees has given him an unmatched knowledge of how to best train adult learners. During our sessions, he not only helped me develop the techniques to be a great presenter, but he told me exactly why those techniques work and why they are important to my audience. I was quickly able to incorporate many of his tried-and-true methods, such as standing in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sweet spot\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and making eye-contact with everyone every few minutes, and IMMEDIATELY saw an improvement with my class engagement and understanding.

Always accommodating, he meets others on their terms and speaks their language in order to communicate everything necessary. You will be hard pressed to catch Jason idly spinning his wheels or wasting time. Everything he does is for a reason and is building toward something. Given the variety of education and psychology theory that he has spontaneously absorbed and researched over the years, Jason always tailors a custom plan for growth and development based on what is truly needed then and there. Every roadblock is anticipated and resolved before it occurs. It is very easy to work with Jason. As a true leader, he always makes you feel like you were the one to come up with the solution, or you arrived at your own realizations without any guidance on his part. Would that more of us were so gentle yet effective.\u00e2\u20ac\u009dAnthony Arlotta- Technical TrainerFrequently Asked QuestionsQ: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153How will this Instructional Design course help me?\u00e2\u20ac\u009dA:\u00c2\u00a0It depends on who you are\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6..If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a business owner, this certification is a great way to learn instructional design yourself. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a great way to train and certify members of your own team and get them up to speed in half the time on the latest instructional design trends and best practices.If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a consultant, this certification is a practical way to show that you are an Instructional Design Specialist, which could help you attract better, higher-paying clients, boost their ROI and efficiency, and lower turnover, safety and security concerns.If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a student, this certificate can set you apart from other graduates who may have a business or education degree, but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the specialized skills that employers today are looking for.If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re an employee or training professional, this certificate can make you more valuable to your company, which can get you that raise or promotion you may deserve (but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a reason to request).Q: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153How valuable is this Instructional Design Course?\u00e2\u20ac\u009dA:\u00c2\u00a0The course itself is highly valuable if your goal is to set yourself apart from the competition.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s even MORE valuable than any course is the knowledge and understanding you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to gain when you take this class and pass all the tests. You will know instructional design. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll say that again: YOU WILL KNOW INSTRUCTIONAL DESIGN.Q: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When do I have to finish the class?\u00e2\u20ac\u009dA:\u00c2\u00a0You can go at whatever pace suits you best! You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got a lot of other things going on in your life, so just because you enroll in the workshop doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean you need to complete it right away. In fact, you can start and finish the workshop whenever you want. Either way, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to be there with you every step of the way to ensure you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re successful and can get certified.Q: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153How soon can I finish the class?\u00e2\u20ac\u009dA:\u00c2\u00a0The Instructional Design Mastery class is in three parts.\u00c2\u00a0 You will need the three courses on Udemy to complete the 16 hours of video training, so if you are dedicating yourself full time to it, you could probably finish in 3 days, but we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recommend that. Instead, we recommend you take 7 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 14 days (if you can give your full attention to the material. If you only have a little bit of time each day, then you should dedicated 4 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 6 weeks to finish it up and take the test.Q: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153How certain can I be that I will finish?\u00e2\u20ac\u009dA: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s never a guarantee. If it was, then our course wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean anything. Instead, it does mean something, and because of that, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to have to work at this thing to get completed. When you do finish, you can be certain that it will actually mean something. The class and the activities are both going to challenge you, but rest assured we make everything simple, easy to understand, and quick to learn. With that said, you will have to earn your completion.Q: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153How hard is the course?\u00e2\u20ac\u009dA:\u00c2\u00a0You can liken our course to the story of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153goldilocks and the three bears\u00e2\u20ac\u009d \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not too hot and not too cold. In other words, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re hard enough that you need to study and know your stuff, but we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make them intentionally hard just to be difficult. We make them as hard as they need to be to make sure you know how to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Rule the Room\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. We believe learning doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen until a behavior change occurs, so to preserve the integrity of this certification, we have made the test challenging and the questions specific to our proprietary Rule the Room Train the Trainer techniques, methodologies and recipes. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect to pass the test just because you have taken other trainings or certification courses in the past. This training is different, and the course will reflect those differences.Q: Why are Instructional Designers so valuable?A:\u00c2\u00a0Instructional Design is the front line effort of all your training and retention efforts. If you know how to develop appropriate content at the right time in the employee and customer journey, and EXACTLY how to implement it, then you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be able to build a path to better results and ensure everyone knows how to do their part in the best way possible. When you can help others teach twice as much in even less time, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be one of the most essential employees at your organization.",

Ultimately, someone who understands American history understands America, and by extension themselves.This general survey course is intended to give participants a broad understanding of US History from the arrival of native peoples to the end of the Reconstruction era that followed the Civil War.The course is divided into 11 thematic sections that are chronologically ordered. Each covers the people, places, ideas, and events that were most influential to our nations development. Each of these sections includesMultiple course lectures which combine carefully organized and outlined notes, images, and music to give you a broad overview of the topic.A selection of carefully selected historic documents that provide the opportunity to read more about important events first-hand through the words of people who were there.Each unit concludes with a quiz that tests your overall knowledge of the entire thematic unit.This course is comparable to a full semester of college-level U.S. History, but is simplified to ensure it remains relevant to the widest audience possible. It can also be completed at your own pace, so you can breeze through it in a few weeks, or carefully analyze it over a few months.Amateur historians, AP students looking for review material, people getting ready for vacation, and anyone else with a genuine interest in the presidents, military conflicts, social movements, locations, and everything else that is a part of our nation's story will find this course to be especially rewarding.If you've ever wished you had a better understanding of our nation's origins, but don't want to suffer through a dry, boring textbook, this is the course for you!",

It helps you to identify and emphasize areas of interest in data behavior, to express your thoughts, observations, and conclusions to others in a quick and intuitive way.Why MATLAB?1. Ease of UseMATLAB is an interpreted language. Programs may be easily written and modified with the built-in integrated development environment and debugger.2. Platform IndependenceMATLAB is supported on many different computer systems, providing a large measure of platform independence. The language is supported on Windows, Linux, Unix, Macintosh. Programs written on any platform will run on all of the other platforms.4. Device-Independent PlottingMATLAB, unlike other computer languages, has many integral plotting and imaging commands. The plots and images can be displayed on any graphical output device supported by the computer on which MATLAB is running. This capability makes MATLAB an outstanding tool for visualizing data.5. Full set capabilitiesMATLAB has all graphics functions necessary to visualize scientific and engineering data. It includes features for representation of two-dimensional and three-dimensional diagrams, three-dimensional volume visualization, animation, tools to create diagrams interactively and the possibility of exporting to the most popular graphic formats. It is possible to customize diagrams adding multi-axes, change the colors of the lines and markers, add annotations, LaTeX expressions, legends and other plotting options.Why this course?Breaks the complex plot techniques down into simplistic steps.Easy and intuitive approach from professional trainers.Ideal for students, academics, scientists.Suitable for beginner programmers.",

I'll explain more about this in the Intro to the course, but for now, let's just say that there is only one way to naturally start speaking Spanish and that's how I will teach you.This course is 100% conversational.I will NOT cover grammar rules, reading, etc. None of the boring stuff, only the fun stuff. Everything and anything you need to GET started. To be able to talk, speak and have conversations.__________Spanish for beginners starts with this:Greetings.Introductions.Words and phrases for Traveling.Days of the Week.Months of the Year.And more to come...__________About your Instructor:I\u00c2\u00a0was born in Bogota, the capital of Colombia (South America). So I'm a native Spanish speaker but you could also consider me a native English speaker. I've lived in the U.S., Mexico, Colombia and currently live in Australia. And I've always felt really passionate about languages, specially English & Spanish.The Accent of this Course: My accent in\u00c2\u00a0Spanish is from Colombia (South America). In English I'd say it's a weird mix of American, Australian and Latin American. But don't worry too much about accents, they're overrated. And regardless of whether you learn Spanish from someone from Spain or someone from Latin America chances are you'll have the accent of a foreigner speaking Spanish. But that doesn't matter!! People will still understand you. As they understand me in Spanish and English when I travel the world even though I might have a \"weird\" accent :)If you are concerned about the accent you should know this:of all Spanish speaking countries, the two countries which probably have the most \"neutral\" Spanish are Colombia and Costa Rica. Hence, many call center companies preferring candidates from these two locations. So, it's definitely an advantage to be learning from a teacher with a Colombian accent.__________This course is for:Beginners.English speakers who want to learn Spanish. You don't need to be native English speaker, but you need to know English to take this course.People who want to learn Spanish.People who love Spanish.People who appreciate Spanish and its importance.People who realize Spanish can open the door to both professional and personal growth.People traveling to a Spanish speaking country.People doing business with Spanish speakers.People who want to have fun in Spanish.This course is NOT for:Intermediate or advanced Spanish speakers.People who want to learn from someone who speaks Spanish with a\u00c2\u00a0\"Spanish\" accent (so someone from Spain, I'm not from Spain).People who are not willing to practice.People who prefer quantity over quality.__________Pledge to All Students(both current & future students)Students First. I will never compromise your experience to make money. Never, ever.\u00c2\u00a0Yes, this is also a business but to me teaching goes way beyond making money. I already have a full time job and fortunately don't rely\u00c2\u00a0on teaching to survive. You are always at the forefront of my courses and I want to ensure you have a unique, valuable and memorable experience. I promise.24x7x365 Support.You can contact me 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, year round, even on holidays, Christmas and New Years Eve\u00c2\u00a0I will get back to you quickly\u00c2\u00a0(in a few hours tops) and deliver outstanding quality of service in my support. I promise.Humbleness, kindness and social responsibility.I believe in giving back to you and the world. So think of me as your own real-life human\u00c2\u00a0\"Siri.\" If you need advice or support just ask.\u00c2\u00a0And if I can do something to help you in your journey, I will.\u00c2\u00a0I promise.Australian Made.Recognized in the Industry as a symbol of quality and excellence. All my courses are Made in Australia with high tech and professionally edited. They also include my secret sauce: a lot of passion & love! I also apply in my courses everything I've learnt from years of experience working with technology, projects, entrepreneurs\u00c2\u00a0and people all over the world. I promise.Quality over Quantity. I will strive to make courses concise, to the point and relevant. Time is one of our most valuable assets and we need to invest it carefully. So I won't\u00c2\u00a0make a course long for the purpose of displaying it has more hours only when strictly necessary.\u00c2\u00a0To me it's about quality and if I can deliver that in 5 minutes and save you time, I will. I promise.",

Each day we will focus on one of the twelve tenses.If you are a teacher I have designed the course so that you can focus one each of the different ways we use each tense individually.How is the course structured?Each section will start with anintroduction video.Then, we have videos thatexplain when and how we use the tense in that section.Finally, there is anassignmentfor you to do toprove to yourself (and me!)that you fully understand the tense.I have tried to explain each of the tenses in a way that isvery understandablethrough the use ofclear pronunciation, enunciation and enthusiasmcombined with the use ofshort videos.Why should I choose this course over other courses?Enthusiastic teacher.Secondly, I think I teach this course in an enthusiastic way and hope\n that this enthusiasm spreads to you. I believe that if you want to \nlearn anything, you must be enthusiastic or you will simply give up.There is a finish line that you can see.By knowing that this course is only 12 days (if you one section per day), I hope that it provides \nyou with the feeling that it is short sprint and not a marathon.Consistency is key (or king).It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much more effective to study a few minutes a day than to study \nfor a few hours once or twice a week. I want English to be your hobby \nthat you enjoy not your habit that you hate. By only studying for a few \nminutes a day (but doing it every day) it is less likely that you will \ncome to hate learning.Remember what you learn.By limiting ourselves to focusing on one tense per day we are able to prevent the common confusions experienced by overloading yourself with various aspects of grammar.Develop a habit for learning.Finally, many people say that it takes 2 weeks to develop a \nhabit. I hope this course will provide you with the framework to develop\n a habit of study. While this is my second course here on \nUdemy, there are many other fantastic courses on here to study. I hope \nthat you can use this course as a stepping stone for your continued \ngrowth.Sign up now and start speaking right away!So, if you want to learn to speak English more with more accuracy and finally bury some of those grammar demons then why not enroll in this course? You will \nbe very glad you did!!!Thank you and see you soon,Joel",

        "description": "My name is Andy Krieger and I am an American living in Vancouver, Canada. I was fortunate to attend and graduate from Stanford University. At Stanford, I heard a great speech by President Kennedy's brother-in-law. It was such a powerful presentation that I signed up immediately after, to teach in Africa for 2 years, all based on the way this great man talked.Ever since then, I have tried to speak like Sargent Shriver. I am always complimented on the way I speak and I can get my students to talk in this elegant, articulate, thoughtful way. It is TOTALLY related to, what you want to learn, Accent Reduction!I was a grade 7 and 10 teacher in Vancouver, for 7 year, after my teaching in Africa with the US Peace Corps. Then I spent 14 years in Hollywood, hiring movie and TV extras (the people behind the actors who don't speak) for thousands of shows. Every day I was on a movie set, and started to LOVE the way actors talked. An important part of my job today is teaching actors how to speak in a certain way that will get them the part. I used this method to also teach Accent Reduction.24 years ago, I 'discovered' a way to teach foreign accent reduction. I have taught successfully over 24,000 wonderful students, from Jackie Chan, to Liu Yifei (the star of the Disney movie, \"Mulan,\" to the very, very famous Chinese actress, Li Bing Bing, to regular people, like YOU, who are looking for accent reduction on Udemy.No one has ever learned in school how to teach accent reduction, the way I teach it. Not one course on Udemy gets immediately to the basics of my course:speak more slowlythen you have time to put your TONGUE and LIPS into certain, exact positions, which I figured out, because I speak this way, using my tongue and lips when I speak. It is totally unique.Then the student brings in and then pushes out an amount of air.The secret, is making every word have a LONG VOWELto sound thoughtful and intelligent by speaking with pausesI am dynamic instructor and I do not waste 1 minute of your time. Not one other course on Udemy teaches what I do. Within even the first 15 minutes of the course, you will copy me and be speaking without your accents!!! I have thousands of testimonials from my students from famous actors and regular people, just like YOU. I have had success in teaching students from EVERY major language: Mandarin, Cantonese, Spanish, French, Hindi, Arabic, Korean, Japanese, Thai, Russian, etc.There are so many reasons why thousands of Udemy subscribers would wantto take my course:\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 you are tired of people saying, \"what did you say\" or \"sorry, I don't understand\" or \"can you please repeat that\"\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 you need to have an interview for a job, or trying to get another, better job\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 you want to feel more confident to speak EnglishThe power points I have made are professional and perfect for learning my Method. I speak directly to you, the student and have you speaking, by copying me. Copy how I tell you to say the word(s). Right away you can hear the correct way to speak without your foreign accent.Please message me with any and all questions, I am happy to help!",

Because data are stored in matrices, algorithms developed in linear algebra are extremely useful.The purpose of this course is to teach you some matrix-based data analysis methods in neural time series data, with a focus on multivariate dimensionality reduction and source-separation methods. This includes covariance matrices, principal components analysis (PCA), generalized eigendecomposition (even better than PCA!), and independent components analysis (ICA). The course is mathematically rigorous but is approachable to individuals with no formal mathematics background. The course comes with MATLAB and Python code (note that the videos show the MATLAB code and the Python code is a close match).You should take this course if you are a...neuroscience\u00c2\u00a0researcher\u00c2\u00a0who is looking for ways to analyze your multivariate\u00c2\u00a0data.student\u00c2\u00a0who wants to be\u00c2\u00a0competitive for a neuroscience PhD or postdoc position.non-neuroscientist\u00c2\u00a0who is\u00c2\u00a0interested in learning more about the big questions in modern brain science.independent learner who wants to advance your linear algebra knowledge.mathematician, engineer, or physicist who is curious about applied matrix decompositions in neuroscience.person who wants to learn more about principal components analysis (PCA) and/or independent components analysis (ICA)intrigued by the image that starts off the Course Preview and want to know what it means! (The answers are in this course!)Unsure if this course is right for you?I\u00c2\u00a0worked hard to make this course accessible to anyone with at least minimal linear algebra and programming background.

So you can now correlate what a learner learns AND what they can do in the real world.The key to this is xAPI statements. Short statements of who did the learning, what action they did, and a description of the action. These statements are then sent to a Learning Record Store (LRS) database, almost like a social media feed. You can then take those statements and create meaningful reports that give you more significant insights into learning than possible with SCORM inside a Learning Management System (LMS).This course is designed to help you get started with xAPI you will get an overview of what it is, and its potential for learning analytics. You will then see how to use xAPI in standard eLearning tools you may already be using, like Articulate Storyline and Adobe Captivate. We will also explore templates and tools that make custom xAPI easy.If you are here to dive deeper, we also cover the custom code you need to fully control how and when your xAPI statements get sent to this LRS. This portion of the course is optional but allows you to customize fully how xAPI is sent over.So join me in this course, and let's cover everything you need to know to hit the ground running with xAPI.",

Moreover, I will later\u00c2\u00a0add some useful text files with additional explanations and hints about the structure of the Norwegian language, and some quizzes so you can check up upon your progress.Without any previous knowledge of Norwegian you will probably watch the videos several times. How much time it will take to acquire the course will depend on your previous language learning experience, but roughly you might need three-four hours of study to acquire solid basics.The course has some introductory remarks on Norwegian language and some remarks about how I teach pronunciation in the course. This is followed by a part on greetings and exchange of personal information,  then a part on meta-language, e.g. how you ask what something means, and then some useful words like numbers and weekdays.You should take this course if you want to learn the basics of Norwegian communication properly in a fun way.",

I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve collaborated with medical writer Dr. Jessica Martin to bring you this course so you can eliminate some of the common errors in your scientific, academic, or medical writing and earn the trust of your readers, which is so important in this field.If you are aresearcher or clinician, you may think that the science is the most important part of what you do. But writing up your results and communicating them in an error-free way is just as important.\u00c2\u00a0 Alternatively, if you're acopyeditor or copywriter, you may find writing about and editing science intimidating. However, editing and proofreading medical and scientific writing is a great way to boost your income in this growing and in-demand field. Don't shy away from these opportunities!\u00c2\u00a0Instead, take this course so that you can begin to learn the conventions and common errors in medical and scientific writing, and find the high-paying clients that you have been looking for!By eliminating these 15 errors in your scientific and medical writing, you will create a great first impression.In this course, the 15 most common errors are broken up into three categories:Grammar. In this section, we will discuss verb tense. When should you write in the present tense? When should you write in the past tense? We will also discuss nouns that are always plural, such as data, and how to use verbs that agree in number. We will talk about proper hyphenation, which is frequently a struggle for writers who are not used to the many compound adjectives and phrases used in science writing.Style mistakes. Mistakes in style are things like inconsistent word or abbreviation usage, incorrect comparisons, and sentence set-up.Misused words. Some misused words that we discuss are applicable to all types of writing (such \"that\" versus \"which\" and \"ie\" versus \"eg\") and some are specific to science writing, like the use of the word \u00e2\u20ac\u0153significant.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d And, importantly, this section includes a lesson on person-first language to ensure your scientific and medical writing is sensitive to all people.Perhaps you are\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6aresearcher, academic, scientist, professor, or doctorwho struggles to write in an error-free manner, resulting in manuscript rejections or revisions that focus more on the writing style than the substance of your work.already askilledwriter, but not so familiar with the quirks that come along with science writing this course will make your writing the best it can be.afreelance copyeditor or copywriterand want to expand your clientele to include more lucrative and profitable scientific and medical jobsAll you need is high school-level English and English language proficiency to get started and, of course, a need or desire to use that writing in a scientific or medical arena.

        "description": "Welcome to course 5 :-)Voici le cinqui\u00c3\u00a8me cours - here is the fifth course of the 3 Minute French series. This course leads on perfectly from course 4 and builds on the knowledge of talking about the past that we touched on previously.Remember, in order to get the most out of the 3 Minute French series, keep your study sessions short enough that you don't feel like French is becoming a chore. It might be tempting to set aside a couple of hours to learn, but the best way to really acquire all the new knowledge is to give your brain time to process it - and that takes place in between lessons.In each lesson, you'll be learning lots of new vocabulary, linguistic structures and useful information for speaking French fluently. However, in order for all of this to find a home safely in your brain, you have to go away and think about it. It's much better to have a three-minute lesson, and then go away and process what you've learnt for the rest of the day, than to sit watching videos for an hour and then to feel so drained you want to think about anything but French for the rest of the evening!A new idea needs time to embed itself in your mind. When you learn something, the time afterwards when you play around with the idea and try building your own sentences in French is when deep learning takes place.In this lesson, we are really expanding our vocabulary and opening up huge new areas of the French language. We'll be looking at new ways to use adjectives with the little phrasequelque chose de, we'll be looking at the useful phraseil y a, and it's question equivalent,y a-t-il?, and we'll also get introduced to possibly the most useful phrase in the French languageest-ce que.We'll also be looking at lots of very useful adverbs that will add variety and depth to our language. Phrases liketrop de,beaucoup deandchoses \u00c3\u00a0are great for opening up new areas of conversation.We'll also start to look at ways that French and English differ. You can't always translate things word-for-word, and the past tense is a great example of this. We'll be looking at how English often has more than one way to say the same thing, which can sometimes cause problems when we're trying to work out how to say something in French.The past tense, or more specifically, the present perfect tense, is the tense we're going to be looking at in depth in this course. We'll look at how to form it with regular verbs, we'll look at some common irregular verbs, and also look at the different things it can mean in English in the positive and negative.That's just a brief look at a few of things we'll be learning in this course, but there will be much more.",

        "description": "My course is aimed at English speakers who would like to learn basic Japanese Conversation. They do not require any prior knowledge of Japanese. I begin by teaching basic grammar so that students can quickly begin to construct their own sentences. Then I teach practical themes like greetings, counting, days of the week, colours, shapes, shopping, ordering and so on, and grammar: pronouns, particles such as 'wa' 'ga' 'no' 'de' and 'ni' , interrogative pronouns, adjectives, verbs, conjugated forms and so on. Each lesson is related to the former lesson, which enables learners to review and learn more. I frequently compare Japanese grammar to English grammar to avoid confusion. At the end of the course, students will be able to hold basic conversations in Japanese.IntroductionLesson 1 - Simple SentencesLesson 2 - Introduce YourselfLesson 3 - Demonstrative PronounsLesson 4 - Interrogative Pronoun: WhatLesson 5 - Days of the WeekLesson 6 - Particle 'no'Lesson 7 - Possession 'no'Lesson 8 - Particle 'to' and 'mo'Lesson 9 - Family MembersLesson 10 - Interrogative pronoun: WhoLesson 11 - Vocabulary & Particles 'ne','yo' and 'yone'Lesson 12 - Numbers & Time ExpressionsLesson 13 - Vocabulary & ShoppingLesson 14 - AdjectivesLesson 15 - Adjectives in SentencesLesson 16 - Adjectives in Sentences (2)Lesson 17 - Particle 'o' & Verbs: present / future tenseLesson 18 - Interrogative pronoun: What (2)Lesson 19 - A Substitute of the VerbLesson 20 - Conjunction 'soshite' & Particle 'mo'Lesson 21- Interrogative pronoun: WhereLesson 22 - Expressions of Positional RelationshipsLesson 23 - Particle 'ni' (1)Lesson 24 - Particle 'ni' (2)Lesson 25 - Verbs: past tenseLesson 26 - Adverb (1)Lesson 27 - Particle 'de' (1)Lesson 28 - Interrogative pronoun: WhenLesson 29 - SuggestionsLesson 30 - Present PerfectLesson 31 - Clock TimeLesson 32 - Particle 'ni' (3)Lesson 33 - Particle 'de' (2)Lesson 34 - Adverbs (2)Lesson 35 - Desire FormLesson 36 - Particle 'ni' (4)Lesson 37 - Adjectives: past tenseLesson 38 - ConjunctionsLesson 39 - Adverbs (3)Lesson 40 - Review - Quick Review for the Section 1Additional Section - Review in Japanese writing - The conversation written in Japanese",

I, at the beginning, thought this sentence is nothing but a typical persuasive sentence to attract more students. Now, I am convinced that it is really the best course I have ever come across. Writing task 1 has always been the biggest nightmare for me. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t why I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand graphs, tables and all these stuffs. My mind doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work when someone gives me directions. I took IELTS course from Magoosh, Road to IELTS and enrolled in several courses on Udemy. It seems that not everyone covers every aspect of the writing task 1. This course has been the most comprehensive course so far. I felt it necessary to leave an honest review that can help others to take a right decision. I will outline the main reasons why I liked this course below. 1. The slides are extremely beautifully designed. I just feel reading them when I see the colorful slides. 2. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very engaging, and not boring like other courses. 3. The instructor is extremely knowledgeable and experienced. I was surprised that how come he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t leave any single aspect of the task 1. The vocabulary he provided, the sample answers he gave, and the sentence structures he taught are just perfect to achieve a band 9. 4. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more than a writing task 1 course. The grammar section is very concise and to the point. He made the grammar section super easy to understand with lots of useful examples. God bless you Shay. I cannot thank you enough. Much love and good wishes.\"\u00e2\u20ac\u201dThe Piercing Star\"WOW!! I'm so glad to have taken this course. I learned from Youtube and some other online blogs, but this is the best course I have seen so far!\"\u00e2\u20ac\u201dMartin Wolski\"Thanks a lot. This was one of the best IELTS courses which I have watched up to now . Thanks a million for your nice and great job. I wish you and your family the bests.\"\u00e2\u20ac\u201dAkbar Zahiri\"I did not expect such well-designed and focus lectures. It is amazing. Well done.\"\u00e2\u20ac\u201dElnazeer Eisa\"Actually, it is the best choice for me. Although I don't intend to take IELTS now,I took advantages of the course and learned many hints and keys to IELTS exam. The teacher is really professional as he uses the best ways of explanation and especially the section of common errors. Thank you gratefully.\"\u00e2\u20ac\u201dSara Muhammed Abdalsalam Abdaldaym\"Shay made everything about speaking crystal clear, he also included a lot of examples which are absolutely essential. I highly recommend this course. Thumbs up!\"\u00e2\u20ac\u201dTri Yudha Sasmita_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________",

I'm also the founder of one of the most popular language learning blogs in the world:I Will Teach You A Language.I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve successfully learned 8 languages myself, so I have a good idea of the struggles you may be facing with sign language, and what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s holding you back.After working with thousands of language learners, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve come to see first-hand what stops people becoming fluent in a new language, and what can be done to fix it. Learning sign language is no different.Today, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to offer you the opportunity to make a difference in your life and the lives of others by learning the basics ofBSL(British Sign Language), so you can start to communicate on a more personal level with the deaf community and play a fuller part in society.What's\u00c2\u00a0Stopping You\u00c2\u00a0Learning Sign Language?If you're reading this page, it's likely that you do want to learn BSL, and it may have been a personal goal for you for some time now. But if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re like most people I know, you probably have no idea where to start!There are lots of reasons you might taken the first step towards learning BSL in the past\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6Maybe you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re short on free time to start a new project?Maybe you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not sure what material to use or where to start?Or perhaps you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve just been putting it off for a while and simply need a push to get started?On the other hand...Maybe you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve tried to learn BSL in the past, but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get very farDo you already know a few signs but struggle to put sentences together?Or maybe your learning is just a bit disorganised and you lack a planDo you already know a few signs but struggle to put sentences together?Or maybe your learning is just a bit disorganised and you lack a plan?BSL is the first or preferred language of over 50,000 deaf people in the United Kingdom, and approximately 1 in every 1,000 children is born with a severe or profound hearing loss (according Disability. co . uk). Not only that, but BSL has also been an official language of the UK since 2003. All this means that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no better time to master the basics of BSL than right now.Introducing... Breakthrough BSLBreakthrough BSLis\u00c2\u00a0a brand new online programme I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve created to teach you to communicate in BSL in just a few minutes a day, and start to bring about a positive change in your life.This\u00c2\u00a0is a concise, hands-on, practical course, designed by experts, to teach you the key signs you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll need to interact in common, everyday situations in BSL, and put a smile on someone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s face.Learn The Fundamentals Of BSL:It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important you master the basics of BSL from the very beginning, so you have rock-solid foundation and can start communicating with deaf people in your life right away. With this course, a solid foundation is exactly what you get.Learn About Deaf Culture:As well as learning to use sign language, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also learn about deaf culture and the role it plays in the language and the community. By the end of the course you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll not only be able to use BSL to communicate, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also have a better understanding of the deaf community and rich cultural identity that has been created in this country which you may not even be aware of.A Course Designed By Learning Experts:This course is designed to help you learn in the most effective way possible, so that you get real results. The design of the programme draws on many years of language learning and teaching experience.Taught By A BSL Expert With Years Of Experience:Your instructor, Emma, is a BSL expert with years of experience as a teacher and interpreter of the language. The collective expertise that has\u00c2\u00a0gone into the creation of Breakthrough BSL means you can have confidence that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be learning as quickly as possible, in a way that is proven to be effective.Professional Quality Video Lessons:The entire course is shot in beautiful HD video, so not only will you enjoy a state-of-the-art learning experience, but you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have the best seat in the house and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll feel like you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in the room with Emma, receiving personal tuition!Flexible, Online Learning:With Breakthrough BSL you have full control of your study schedule so you can base your learning around your lifestyle, and learn at a time that suits you rather than working to the rigid schedule of a teacher or school.

This means that rather than just teaching you new signs we actively check your comprehension and encourage you to practice new signs as you progress through the course. This means you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll learn faster and remember more than you would with any other course.Communicate with over 9 million hearing-impaired people in Britain:Breakthrough BSL gives you the skills you need to make a difference to the lives of millions of people all over Britain. By the time you complete the course, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be ready to deal with any common, everyday situation in BSL.\u00c2\u00a0 In fact, what makes this course so unique is that when creating the syllabus, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just copy the same old \u00e2\u20ac\u0153standard signs\u00e2\u20ac\u009d you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll learn elsewhere - we actually went out and surveyed hundreds of people across the UK about the specific situations they would like to use BSL in, whether that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s with a family member suffering from hearing loss, interacting with deaf people in everyday situations at work, or simply becoming more socially conscious.Breakthrough BSL is a course for real people, living real lives who want to make a difference in the real word.Learn To Use BSL With Confidence:I understand that learning sign language can be intimidating if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a beginner, so given this is such a practical course, we place an emphasis on teaching you not only to understand the most important signs that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re likely to need but to sign them yourself, with real people, and with confidence, so you can start to communicate with the people in deaf community, without freezing up. When you can do this\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6the results will be life-changing!So, are you ready to make your Breakthrough in BSL?Learn the Basics of BSL Step-by-Step\u00c2\u00a0in Your Free Time!It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter whether you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a complete beginner at BSL, or whether you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve tried to learn any other variety of sign language before. This course will cover everything from the very beginning of BSL, so you have confidence in what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re learning, and know that it will be effective at helping you to communicate with the deaf community.We understand you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re busy, and that you may be worried about taking on an additional commitment, and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s whythis course is delivered in small, bite-sized lessonsthat you can complete at home, on the train, or during your coffee break.The course also works on any device, soyou don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to worry about technical difficulties.(But, just in case you do have a problem, our friendly support team are standing by to assist you with any questions.)Course Structure:5 course modules to teach you BSL step-by-stepVideo Lessons:31 unique lessons in glorious HD-quality videoSupporting material:Downloadable PDF worksheets accompany every lesson so you can revise anywhereAverage video lesson length: 2 min 30 secLanguage: Spoken English with subtitles throughoutLevel: No previous knowledge required - ideal for complete beginners, or those looking for a refreshTechnology: Works on any computer, tablet or mobile deviceLifetime membership: Unlimited access to the course for as long as you need itFree updates: You receive complementary updates to all future versions of the courseSupport: Our friendly support team love answering your questions (however small) over email30-day money-back guarantee:If the course is not right for you we will refund every penny.Course Aims:By the end of the course you will have gained an introductory working knowledge of BSL, so you can\u00c2\u00a0hold a conversation with deaf people and BSL users in everyday situations.You will do this by...Building a\u00c2\u00a0solid knowledge of the alphabet & numbers, so you can \"finger spell\" any word in the English languageLearning vocabulary to talk about a range of common topics (days of the week, verbs, family, etc.), so you can learn the words that are important to you in your unique situationLearning common phrases for everyday interactions and greetings, so you can communicate with deaf people in a meaningful wayPractising all the above with regular revision, comprehension tests, and PDF notes to take away and study anywhereCourse Content:Module 1 -The Alphabet & FingerspellingModule 2 -Your First ConversationsModule 3 -Core VocabularyModule 4 -Expanding Your VocabularyModule 5 -Questions, Emotions & Putting It All TogetherSubtitles:All videos include close captioning so you'll be able to follow along with Emma's explanations, tips and instruction even if you're deaf or hard of hearing.Course requirements:None!

Whatever your experience level is with VFDs this course will give your skills a major boost, especially for the model that we will be working with. Using the quick start manual provided in the course, together we will learn step by step the art of wiring and programming a VFD from scratch!In a nutshell:We start off by pulling our VFD out of the box to familiarise ourselves with it.We then learn how to protect the drive and wire it up to our motor for the first time.Resetting the drive back to it's factory settings is next which will prepare us for our first round of programming.After powering-up our drive we use the keypad controls to fire up our motor and explore some display features.Once we have graduated from the keypad controls we will learn all about remote control wiring.Gradually adding levels of complexity to our installation we move onto using the relay outputs and analog inputs.We then explore some advanced wiring and programming concepts with plenty of demonstrations.To bring it home we look at possible fault situations and the fault codes that relate.In detail we will learn:Power wiringGeneral precautionsKeypad operationMotor parameter entryStart source, stop mode and speed reference2-wire, 3-wire and potentiometer controlRamp time adjustmentRelay output wiring and selector programmingSINK vs SOURCE\u00c2\u00a0configurationExternal supply controlMultiple preset frequency output0-10volt and 4-20ma analog controlElectric brakingPWM output frequencyFlying startProcess factorStart boostVoltage band adjustmentFault codesAnd much more.............If you want to get the edge and learn all about VFDs I'll catch you in the course.Cheers!",

Do you feel you lack the words to describe data? Do you panic at the thought of comparative grammar and complex sentences?I designed this course for anyone who answers 'yes' to any of these questions.After seeing the popularity of myMastering IELTS\u00c2\u00a0Writing: Task 2 (Band 9 Model Answers)course, which has been enrolled upon byover 16,000 studentsand has an average rating of4.7/5, I\u00c2\u00a0decided to make a similar course for IELTS\u00c2\u00a0Writing Task 1 for the Academic module.Throughout the course of each video, we will discover how to effectivelyplanour response for each type of Task 1 question, how to produce a quick and accurate introduction, how totransitionseamlessly between sentences and paragraphs, how to identify main trends and select information which counts as 'key features', how to usevocabularywhich describes data precisely and effectively, and how to include a wealth ofgrammatical complexitywithout sacrificing clarity.This course has been divided into six sections, with each section dedicated to a different type of task:graphs with a trendcomparative graphs tasks withmore than one graph tasks with afuture elementprocesses andmaps. Within each of these sections are three responses, and each of these section's responses looks at a different topic. That makes a total ofeighteen responses!Designing the course in this way allows you to see the different language and the different approaches we use for each of the task types, and it also provides you with a great range of vocabulary and ideas according to different types of data presentation.There are vocabulary exercises following each of the letter lectures which aim toconsolidate the vocabularyyou have learnt in that video. These will also provide you with a copy of each response in document form.To make the most out of thisModel Answerscourse, it is strongly recommended that you go through the original'Mastering IELTS\u00c2\u00a0Writing: Task 1 (Academic)'course before beginning\u00c2\u00a0as all of the responses here rely on thestrategies, vocabulary, grammar and general guidancetaught in\u00c2\u00a0that course.\u00c2\u00a0This course has an average rating of4.7/5from over17,000 studentsand over2,000 reviews, so it's definitely worth checking out!However, you can still benefit a lot from these model answers if you take the two courses at the same time.And if you have any questions as you work your way through the lectures, don't hesitate to contact me via Udemy's Q&A feature.See you inside the course!",

Join other 1,000+ students and pass business calculus with flying colors!So...Are you a business student\u00c2\u00a0frustrated by business calculus, finding it too hard, fast-paced\u00c2\u00a0and/or abstract?Is learning business calculus as much (or even less) fun than watching paint dry?Does your professor have you finding derivatives, when you can't even remember how to divide fractions?If you answered yes to any of the questions above, this course is for you.Easiest Way To Understand Business Calculus... Guaranteed!For these\u00c2\u00a0reasons, I created the essential business calculus course, specifically designed for business students. This course\u00c2\u00a0avoids the complexity and boringness\u00c2\u00a0of your college textbook/professor to explain concepts and problems clearly. Instead, in this course, you will find the following:Clear and to-the-point explanations of all the important concepts in business calculusPractice problems for every concept explained, which are done step-by-step with a voiceover so you know exactly what's going onPractice exercises for you to solve after learning a new conceptsDozens of mental tricks (mnemonics) I\u00c2\u00a0have developed over the years to easily remember definitions and complex rulesA summary of the most important concepts for each section for you to easily reviewTake my course, and business calculus\u00c2\u00a0will finally start making sense for you. Trust me, there will be a lot of \"oohs\" and \"ahhs\" in this course :-)Who This Course is ForIf you are a business student and you are struggling through business calculus, this course was made for you!MnemonicsI have developed several \"mnemonics\" (mental tricks used to remember things easily), which will make even the hardest concepts in the class fun and easy to remember. For example you might be wondering...- What does a famous\u00c2\u00a0Canadian catchphrase have to do with logarithms?- How in the world are the chain rule and an \"ugly\u00c2\u00a0Xbox\" related?- Can thinking about a driver's license help you solve a continuity problem?These and many more\u00c2\u00a0associations will have you remembering calculus concepts in a breeze. They are especially useful, as all of us sometimes happen to blank out when we have a question in front of us.What the Course CoversThe course covers the main topics given in a typical business calculus class. You are pretty much guaranteed to see most, if not all of the topics below as you go through your semester.Functions and GraphingLimits and ContinuityDerivativesDifferentiation RulesApplications of DerivativesExponential &\u00c2\u00a0Logarithmic FunctionsIntegralsOf course, I am always adding new tutorials to this course. If you don't see your topic listed here, send me a private message and I will help in any way I can.Who The F*!& Are You?Hi, my name is Luis, and I\u00c2\u00a0have been tutoring calculus for business (also known as MAC2233 or MAC 2233 in some universities) for the past 8 years. I understand 100% how frustrating, difficult and painful this class is to a lot of business students.Students\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 hatred for business calculus is well-documented. We tutors of course agree it is difficult. But its difficulty is largely because the explanations provided by\u00c2\u00a0typical textbooks/professors are completely\u00c2\u00a0horrible. They are unclear, ambiguous and too long.My PromiseAs I explain in the course itself,business calculus is not easy. Especially for business students, who wonder why they have to take this class all the time.\u00c2\u00a0My course removes the frustration out of business calculus and makes things clear.What my course does\u00c2\u00a0is present business calculus concepts in a structured manner and in a way that\u00c2\u00a0is easy to understand.\u00c2\u00a0By going over the course, and complementing that with going to class and doing your homework, I\u00c2\u00a0can assure you you will crush this class.Shall We?Are you ready to conquer\u00c2\u00a0business calculus?As the wise\u00c2\u00a0Shia LaBeouf said once, \"JUST\u00c2\u00a0DO\u00c2\u00a0IT!\"P.S.\u00c2\u00a0If you don't like the course, you can ask for a refund within 30 days. No questions asked! So there's absolutely no risk for you. Give the course a try and see why more than 500 students have crushed business calculus with this course.",

In his letter to Corinth, Paul confronts these divisions with wisdom and tact.In this intriguing online course, Professor N.T. Wright examines 1 Corinthians Chapters 1-10, and explores how the Apostle Paul dealt in practical terms with difficult, controlling, divisive people. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also learn more about Paul\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s views on marriage and human sexuality, and how he navigated questions of conscience and the limits of freedom.

What is the difference between 'kennen' and 'wissen'? Why do I need three different ways of expressing the subjunctive mood? And where do I place the word 'nicht'? These and many more questions will be answered in this course.We will start off with an entry level test to make sure your A1-level is solid and can be built upon, as this course follows my A1 grammar course. Alternatively, you can check the A1 grammar course content list to see if you're covered.You will then learn all the important German grammar points and more on an elementary to intermediate level (A2 to B1).I will illustrate the grammar points with many real-life examples that are translated in-course, so you will be able to pick up quite a bit of vocabulary as well.For each lecture, I added a pdf-sheet with the complete lecture content. There is also a pdf-worksheet attached to almost all lectures with exercises, and some of them contain additional information.The German language levels concerning grammar (A1-B1) don't have a clear-cut curriculum. Some topics are typically taught on certain levels but depending on the course they might come up sooner or later. So if you switch courses, you might miss out on some material. To give you a better orientation, I added the levels to my course lectures in which the topic typically appears first.Lecture (A2): usually comes up in level A2Lecture (B1): usually comes up in level B1Lecture (Plus): Not always covered in the common level-oriented curriculumIn my experience, the A2 topics are also of interest to intermediate learners because in common textbooks they are often brought up but not worked out in detail. Many learners go into the B1 level with a lot of A2-questions unanswered. That's why I included them - in detail, with hopefully all questions answered. And if you still have any questions, there's a Q&A, where you can find many answers or simply ask your individual questions.I hope your learning experience will be splendid! And now let's get started - Los geht's!",

I am 25 years old and I am from Germany) or ask \"Hva heter du?\" (What is your name?).Additionally, at the A1 level, learners should be able to handle simple, everyday tasks such as ordering food in a restaurant, asking for directions, or making purchases at a store. For example, they should be able to say \"Jeg vil gjerne ha en kopp kaffe, takk\" (I would like a cup of coffee, please) or \"Unnskyld, hvor er n\u00c3\u00a6rmeste apotek?\" (Excuse me, where is the nearest pharmacy?).

Perhaps you are not confident in your ability to maintain one tone throughout your letter?Do you find it difficult to generate or develop ideas? Are you unable to join your ideas together cohesively?Are you stuck with limited vocabulary for different topics and tones? How about your range of grammatical constructions?I designed this course for anyone who answers 'yes' to any of these questions.After seeing the popularity of myMastering IELTS\u00c2\u00a0Writing: Task 2 (Band 9 Model Answers)course, which has been enrolled upon byover 18,000 students, I\u00c2\u00a0decided to make a similar course for IELTS\u00c2\u00a0Writing Task 1 for the IELTS\u00c2\u00a0General Training module.Throughout the course of each video, we will discover how to effectivelyplanour letter for each task, how to demonstrate a clearpurposefrom the get-go, how totransitionseamlessly between sentences and paragraphs, how to appropriately use 'letter language', and how to include a wealth ofgrammatical complexitywithout sacrificing clarity.This course has been divided into three sections, with each section dedicated to a different letter tone:informalsemi-formal andformal. Within each of these sections are six letters, and each of these section's letters carries a different purpose and focuses on a different topic. That makes a total ofeighteen letters!Designing the course in this way allows you toclearly distinguishthe different language used across the tones, and it also provides you with a great range of vocabulary and ideas according to different purposes and themes in IELTS General Writing Task 1.There are vocabulary exercises following each of the letter lectures which aim toconsolidate the vocabularyyou have learnt in that video. These will also provide you with a copy of each letter in document form. You can also test yourself with three quizzes - one for the end of each section.This course works best as an 'accompaniment' to your main writing studies. In other words, to make the most out of thisModel Answerscourse, it is strongly recommended for\u00c2\u00a0you to go through the original 'Mastering IELTS\u00c2\u00a0Writing: Task 1 (GT)'course before beginning\u00c2\u00a0as all of the letters here rely on thestrategies, techniques and guidancetaught in\u00c2\u00a0that course.However, you can still benefit a lot from these IELTS GT model answers if you take the two courses at the same time.Please note that this course is not appropriate for students studying for IELTS\u00c2\u00a0Speaking, IELTS Reading, IELTS Listening or for students of the TOEFL\u00c2\u00a0exam.And if you have any questions as you work your way through the lectures, don't hesitate to contact me via Udemy's Q&A feature.See you inside the course!",
