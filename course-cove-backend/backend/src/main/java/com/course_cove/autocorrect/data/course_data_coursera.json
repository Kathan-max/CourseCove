If you wish to receive credit for your participation in the course, you will need to complete the full course on the SCCME website at: http://cme.stanford.edu/online. The course version on Coursera does not offer CME credit.\n\nCourse Description\nAntibiotics are among the most frequently prescribed classes of drugs and it is estimated that approximately 50% of antibiotic use, in both the outpatient and inpatient settings, is inappropriate. At the same time, in contrast to any other class of drugs, every antibiotic use has a potential public health consequence \u00e2\u20ac\u201c inappropriate use may not harm only the individual patient, but contributes to societal harm by exerting an unnecessary selective pressure that may lead to antibiotic resistance among bacteria. This video based course will introduce learners to the basic principles of appropriate antibiotic use, demonstrate how to apply these principles to the management of common infections, and outline how to develop and maintain an antimicrobial stewardship program. We will offer a number of illustrative cases, recognizable to the practicing physician in his or her practice to engage learners in the thought processes that lead to optimal decision making, improved outcomes of individual patients, and harm reduction vis-a-vis the bacterial ecology. The course will also explore strategies to implement principles of antimicrobial stewardship both in your practice and also at a program level.\n",

Over the past decades, a new figure has emerged that of the art manager. \nImagine you went to work every day to connect artists with audiences, vision with reality, and money with a mission. That is what managers in the arts do, they play an essential role in transforming the minds, lives, and communities through creative expression.\n\t\nThis course has been conceptualized to address the need of skills and techniques to help professionals and managers in running art and cultural institutions. \n\nLearning Objectives\nThere are three objectives to this course. First, we will approach the biggest issue cultural institutions face, the coexistence of managers and curators and giving evidence as to when, how, and why they can get along. Second, we will focus on some contemporary facets on what is means to manage a cultural institution and what cultural managers should expect and be able to face. And lastly, we will provide models and tools to design and implement appropriate courses of action to satisfy customers (visitors and audiences) and build an advantage over the competition.\n\nCourse Structure\nThe course is divided into six sections. Five sections are dedicated to specific aspects and themes of managing cultural institutions, while the sixth section is dedicated to individual interviews of prominent cultural institution managers on specific topics. The involvement of professionals and managers gives an incredible value to the learning experience of this course. \n\nEach module is paired with a\u00c2\u00a0quiz\u00c2\u00a0and discussion forums to reflect on the variety of the heritage management, its complexity, and the power of the network that we will build together during the course.\nSuccessful completion of the quizzes is required for a course certificate as explained in the Grading Policy page.\n\nIf you love art and want to make an impact in this unique and fantastic sector, this course will support you in understanding the peculiarities of this sector and how to leverage on its tools to make a bigger impact.\n\nLook forward to meeting you online!\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nVatican Museums:\u00c2\u00a0www.museivaticani.va\nCenacolo Vinciano:\u00c2\u00a0\nwww.beniculturali.it/mibac/export/MiBAC/sito-MiBAC/Contenuti/MibacUnif/Eventi/visualizza_asset.html_1283837989.html (ITA)\nFAI (Fondo Ambiente Italiano):\u00c2\u00a0eng.fondoambiente.it\nMUVE (Fondazione Musei Civici Venezia):\u00c2\u00a0www.visitmuve.it\nThe National Trust:\u00c2\u00a0www.nationaltrust.org.uk\nThe Archeological Site of Paestum:\u00c2\u00a0www.museopaestum.beniculturali.it   whc.unesco.org/en/list/842\nMuseo dell'Opera del Duomo (Florence):\u00c2\u00a0www.museumflorence.com\nMuseo del Violino:\u00c2\u00a0www.museodelviolino.org\n_________________________________\nDisclaimer - Since some of the videos are conducted with those whose native language is not English, we have decided to sometimes preserve their more emphatic speech to keep a tighter match between the audio and subtitles.\n",

Did you know, for example, that we are naturally biased towards selling investments that are doing well for us, but holding on to those that are doing poorly? Or that we often select sub-optimal insurance payment plans, and routinely purchase insurance that we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even need? And why do so many of us fail to enroll in our employer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s corporate retirement plans, even when the employer offers to match our contributions?\nBehavioral finance is the study of these and dozens of other financial decision-making errors that can be avoided, if we are familiar with the biases that cause them. In this course, we examine these predictable errors, and discover where we are most susceptible to them. This course is intended to guide participants towards better financial choices.

Brands are thus not only an external promise to customers, but a means of executing business strategy via internal brand-led behaviour and culture change.\n\nYou will learn and practice the following skills:\n\n1.\tHow to build brands from a broad organisational perspective \n2.\tHow to lead brand-led culture change with human resource practices at the core (i.e., brand as a lever and not just an outcome) \n3.\tHow to build brands in multi-brand companies, across cultures and geographies\n4.\tHow to measure brand health in new ways, that is, internally in addition to externally\n5.\tHow to value and capture returns to brands across the organisation - introducing the new concept of employee-based brand equity - and how this is different from the valuation of brands as intangible assets. \n\nThis course allows you to develop the following aspects of yourself:\n\n1.\tHead. Gain a deeper understanding of the evolving practice of brand management, one that goes further than practiced in most organisations today\n2.\tHeart.

It ends up teaching how to understand branding efforts in the context of customer experience.\nWe must think in a strategic manner when creating brands. Branding is about co-creation and conversation between the audiences, customers and users. What is relevant is how people out there perceive and live the brand. Brands are the story, the personality and the culture of an organization the intangible elements that form it. \nApplied Learning Project\nAt the end of each MOOC, you will find a capstone project.

The new competitive landscape requires another, more holistic and strategic perspective, based on the concept of business models.\nThis course gives you access to the Odyssey 3.14 approach, a pioneering framework that will help you invent or reinvent business models.\n\nThis highly innovative approach has been developed by Laurence Lehmann-Ortega and H\u00c3\u00a9l\u00c3\u00a8ne Musikas and has proven to be a very valuable methodology for start-up entrepreneurs, business unit managers and intrapreneurs alike. It offers a practical and highly effective framework and toolbox to create, invent or reinvent business models in a very disciplined way.\n\nThe approach starts with a deep dive into the 3 pillars of the business model:\n- The value proposition (who are our customers and what are we offering them?)\n- The value architecture (how are we organized in order to deliver this value proposition to our customers in due time)\n- The profit equation (how the alignment between the first 2 pillars generates a profit)\n\n14 directions are then explored in order to invent or reinvent a business model. Examples of the directions include \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reducing clients overall costs\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153modifying the revenue stream\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153introducing a third party\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153eliminating a step in the value chain\u00e2\u20ac\u009d, and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153exploring new resources\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. Illustrated by numerous examples, both iconic (Ikea, Tetra Pack, Grameen Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6) and more recent (Airbnb, Zopa, Drive Now\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6), these directions stimulate your creativity to rigorously explore all possible innovation paths. Innovation becomes an adventure, an odyssey\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 hence the name of the approach!\n\nOdyssey 3.14 is the result of over 15 years of research, consulting and teaching. Over 150 companies that have successfully invented or reinvented their business model have been thoroughly analyzed and will inspire you to develop your own new, innovative business model.\n\nThis course is a part of the MSIE program at HEC.

You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll conduct research to collect feedback about your designs and make improvements. Finally, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll learn how to share your designs with development teams and highlight your work in your professional UX portfolio.\nCurrent UX designers and researchers at Google will serve as your instructors, and you will complete hands-on activities that simulate real-world UX design scenarios. Learners who complete the seven courses in this certificate program should be equipped to apply for entry-level jobs as UX designers. \n\nBy the end of this course, you will be able to:\n   - Build mockups and high-fidelity prototypes in Figma.\n   - Define and apply common visual design elements and principles.\n   - Demonstrate how design systems can be used to organize, standardize, and enhance designs.\n   - Understand the role of design critique sessions and feedback while iterating on designs. \n   - Learn how to hand off finished design projects to engineering teams. \n   - Complete mobile app designs to include in a professional UX portfolio. \n\nThis course is suitable for beginner-level UX designers who have completed the previous four courses of the Google UX Design Certificate. Alternatively, learners who have not completed the previous courses should have a strong understanding of the design process, how to create low-fidelity designs on paper and in Figma, and how to conduct usability studies.\n",

Too often though our perceptions about Aboriginal peoples consign them to an ancient past or perpetuates stereotypical imaginations that Aboriginal peoples live in remote communities (Hinkson, 2010).  \n\nAt the heart of this MOOC is the theme that Sovereignty was never ceded and Sydney always was and always will be Aboriginal Land. Despite this the Aboriginal presence in the city is often invisible to non-Aboriginal eyes. This course aims to bring to light marginalised narratives of Aboriginal presence in this space.\n\nTo understand hidden and marginalised narratives and experiences it is necessary to develop cultural competence capabilities. Key elements of practicing cultural competence include being able to understand and interrogate context, which in the case of Sydney includes not only learning about the peoples, places and histories of Aboriginal Sydney but to also understand issues about how knowledge is created and how dominant narratives can exclude diverse knowledges and experiences. \n\nCourse learning outcomes\n\n1.\tDevelop knowledge about cultural competence capabilities. \n2.\tDevelop a deeper and multi-layered knowledge and understanding about Aboriginal peoples, cultures and places in Sydney.\n3.\tDevelop a greater understanding of how history, cultures and places are represented, contested and interpreted and how that relates to their own context. \n\nAcknowledgement of Country\n\nWe acknowledge that this course was developed on the land of the Gadigal Peoples of the Eora nation. We pay our respect to the Traditional Owners of this land and acknowledge that the land that the University of Sydney was built on has been a place of learning for many thousands of years.\n",

However, many excellent books and online courses on algorithms, that excel in introducing algorithmic ideas, have not yet succeeded in teaching you how to implement algorithms, the crucial computer science skill that you have to master at your next job interview. We tried to fill this gap by forming a diverse team of instructors that includes world-leading experts in theoretical and applied algorithms at UCSD (Daniel Kane, Alexander Kulikov, and Pavel Pevzner) and a former software engineer at Google (Neil Rhodes). This unique combination of skills makes this Specialization different from other excellent MOOCs on algorithms that are all developed by theoretical computer scientists. While these MOOCs focus on theory, our Specialization is a mix of algorithmic theory/practice/applications with software engineering. You will learn algorithms by implementing nearly 100 coding problems in a programming language of your choice.\u00c2\u00a0To the best of knowledge, no other online course in Algorithms comes close to offering you a wealth of programming challenges (and puzzles!) that you may face at your next job interview. We invested over 3000 hours into designing our challenges as an alternative to multiple choice questions that you usually find in MOOCs.  \nApplied Learning Project\nThe specialization contains two real-world projects: Big Networks and Genome Assembly. You will analyze both road networks and social networks and will learn how to compute the shortest route between New York and San Francisco 1000 times faster than the shortest path algorithms you learn in the standard Algorithms 101 course! Afterwards, you will learn how to assemble genomes from millions of short fragments of DNA and how assembly algorithms fuel recent developments in personalized medicine.\n",

The interventions evaluated can be drugs, devices (e.g., hearing aid), surgeries, behavioral interventions (e.g., smoking cessation program), community health programs (e.g. cancer screening programs) or health delivery systems (e.g., special care units for hospital admissions). We consider clinical trials experiments because the investigators rather than the patients or their doctors select the treatment the patients receive. Results from randomized clinical trials are usually considered the highest level of evidence for determining whether a treatment is effective because trials incorporates features to ensure that evaluation of the benefits and risks of treatments are objective and unbiased. The FDA requires that drugs or biologics (e.g., vaccines) are shown to be effective in clinical trials before they can be sold in the US.\nThe course will explain the basic principles for design of randomized clinical trials and how they should be reported. In the first part of the course, students will be introduced to terminology used in clinical trials and the several common designs used for clinical trials, such as parallel and cross-over designs.

The three-part MOOC series \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Digitalisation in Aeronautics and Space\u00e2\u20ac\u009d is thus devoted to examining the transformations that have already occurred and forthcoming likely changes, posing the question: what will aerospace science be like in future and what will the influence of digitalisation be on research? An array of research fields are focused on in relation to this question, including artificial intelligence in earth observation, robots in production and digital avionics networks, among others.\nApplied Learning Project\nThe course series projects are devoted to examining the principles of terrestrial technology fields and the disruptive changes caused by digitalisation to the aircraft design process and particularly the challenges arising during the preliminary design phase and eventually to the principle tasks involved in civil aircraft maintenance. Those three assessments try to give the participants an authentic insight into aerospace research fields and possible job tasks emerging in the aerospace industry.\n",

The financial crisis of 2007-2009 is a wakeup call that we need a similar evolution in the analytical apparatus and theories that we use to understand that system. Produced and sponsored by the Institute for New Economic Thinking, this course is an attempt to begin the process of new economic thinking by reviving and updating some forgotten traditions in monetary thought that have become newly relevant.\nThree features of the new system are central.\n\nMost important, the intertwining of previously separate capital markets and money markets has produced a system with new dynamics as well as new vulnerabilities. The financial crisis revealed those vulnerabilities for all to see. The result was two years of desperate innovation by central banking authorities as they tried first this, and then that, in an effort to stem the collapse.  \n\nSecond, the global character of the crisis has revealed the global character of the system, which is something new in postwar history but not at all new from a longer time perspective.  Central bank cooperation was key to stemming the collapse, and the details of that cooperation hint at the outlines of an emerging new international monetary order. \n\nThird, absolutely central to the crisis was the operation of key derivative contracts, most importantly credit default swaps and foreign exchange swaps. Modern money cannot be understood separately from modern finance, nor can modern monetary theory be constructed separately from modern financial theory. That's the reason this course places dealers, in both capital markets and money markets, at the very center of the picture, as profit-seeking suppliers of market liquidity to the new system of market-based credit.\n",

        "description": "There is an increasing attention to ethics in engineering practice. Engineers are supposed not only to carry out their work competently and skilfully, but also to be aware of the broader ethical and social implications of engineering and to be able to reflect on these.  According to the Engineering Criteria 2000 of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) in the US, engineers must have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an understanding of professional and ethical responsibility\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and should \"understand the impact of engineering solutions in a global and societal context.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d \nThis course provides an introduction to ethics in engineering and technology. It helps engineers and students in engineering to acquire the competences mentioned in the ABET criteria or comparable criteria formulated in other countries. More specifically, this course helps engineers to acquire the following moral competencies:\n\n- Moral sensibility: the ability to recognize social and ethical issues in engineering\n- Moral analysis skills: the ability to analyse moral problems in terms of facts, values, stakeholders and their interests\n- Moral creativity: the ability to think out different options for action in the light of (conflicting) moral values and the relevant facts\n- Moral judgement skills: the ability to give a moral judgement on the basis of different ethical theories or frameworks including professional ethics and common sense morality\n- Moral decision-making skills: the ability to reflect on different ethical theories and frameworks and to make a decision based on that reflection.\n\nWith respect to these competencies, our focus is on the concrete moral problems that engineers encounter in their professional practice. With the help of concrete cases is shown how the decision to develop a technology, as well as the process of design and production, is inherently moral. The attention of the learners is drawn towards the specific moral choices that engineers face. In relation to these concrete choices learners will encounter different reasons for and against certain actions, and they will discover that these reasons can be discussed. In this way, learners become aware of the moral dimensions of technology and acquire the argumentative capacities that are needed in moral debates with stakeholders (e.g. governments, users, and commercial business departments).\n",

The goal here is give you a roadmap and framework for how financial professional make decisions.  \nWe will cover the basics of financial valuation, the time value of money, compounding returns, and discounting the future.  You will understand discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation and how it compares to other methods.  We also step inside the mind of a corporate financial manager and develop the basic tools of capital budgeting.  We will survey the how, when, and where to spend money, make tradeoffs about investment, growth, dividends, and how to ensure sound fiscal discipline.  Our journey then turns to a Wall Street or capital markets perspective of investments as we discuss the fundamental tradeoff between risk and return.  We then synthesize our discussion of risk with our valuation framework and incorporate it into series of direct applications to practice.\n\nThis course requires no prior familiarity with finance.  Rather, it is intended to be a first step for anyone who is curious about understanding stock markets, valuation, or corporate finance.  We will walk through all of the tools and quantitative analysis together and develop a guide for understanding the seemingly complex decisions that finance professionals make.  \n\nBy the end of the course, you will develop an understanding of the major conceptual levers that push and pull on financial decision making and how they relate to other areas of business.  The course should also serve as a roadmap for where to further your finance education and it would be an excellent introduction of any students contemplating an MBA or Finance concentration, but who has little background in the area.\n",

This figure represents about 3.5% of the annual World GDP from 2007 to 2030.\n\nThe European Commission estimated, that by 2020, Europe will need between 1.5 - 2 trillion Euros in infrastructure investments. Between 2011 and 2020, about 500 billion Euros will be required for the implementation of the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) program, 400 billion Euros for Energy distribution networks and smart grids, 200 billion Euros on Energy transmission networks and storage, and 500 billion Euros for the upgrade and construction of new power plants. An additional 38 - 58 billion Euros and 181 - 268 billion Euros in capital investment will be needed to achieve the targets set by the European Commission for broadband diffusion.\n\nTraditionally investments in infrastructure were financed using public sources. However, severe budget constraints and inefficient management of infrastructure by public entities have led to an increased involvement of private investors in the business. \n\nThe course focuses on how private investors approach infrastructure projects from the standpoint of equity, debt, and hybrid instruments. \n\nThe course concentrates on the practical aspects of project finance: the most frequently used financial techniques for infrastructure investments. The repeated use of real life examples and case studies will allow students to link the theoretical background to actual business practices.\n\nIn the end of the course, students will be capable of analyzing a complex transaction, identifying the key elements of a deal, and suggesting proper solutions for deal structuring from a financial advisor's perspective.\n\nCourse Format\nThe course will consist of lecture videos, readings, and talks given by guest speakers. Although we do hope you will attend the entire course, it is possible to just focus on single topics.\n\nSuggested Readings\nThe course is designed to be self-contained, there are no obligatory readings that must be acquired outside of the course. \nFor students interested in additional study material, you may refer to:\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2\tGatti Stefano, \"Project Finance in theory and practice\", Academic Press, 2nd edition, 2012.\n",

You will be presented with a set of video lectures and guest speakers.

It begins from the basic building blocks of the functional paradigm, first showing how to use these blocks to solve small problems, before building up to combining these concepts to architect larger functional programs. You'll see how the functional paradigm facilitates parallel and distributed programming, and through a series of hands on examples and programming assignments, you'll learn how to analyze data sets small to large from parallel programming on multicore architectures, to distributed programming on a cluster using Apache Spark. A final capstone project will allow you to apply the skills you learned by building a large data-intensive application using real-world data.\nApplied Learning Project\nLearners will build small to medium size Scala applications by applying knowledge and skills including: functional programming, parallel programming, manipulation of large data sets, higher-order functions, property-based testing, functional reactive programming.\n",

Managerial accounting focuses on the information and the analytical tools and techniques that help managers and employees make the right business decisions. \nIn this Specialization, you will learn the fundamentals of both of these purposes of accounting.  More specifically, you will understand the financial statements that managers create, and be able to interpret and analyze these statements to assess the financial position of the organization.  You will also identify and understand the nature, purpose, and importance of different types of decision-useful accounting information, and use analytical tools and techniques to use this information to make business decisions.  Via the capstone, you will apply these fundamentals via the lens of a new business, creating a business plan, forecasts and budgets, and anticipated information needs for decisions made by you as owner and manager, your employees, and external parties such as future shareholders, creditors, and other constituents.  \n",
